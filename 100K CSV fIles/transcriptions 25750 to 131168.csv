100017," Who is it? It's Jeff. Are you leaving? Yeah. No. I have a girlfriend, so don't get your hopes up. Where is he from? He's from the suburbs of Boston. He's a lawyer at Random House. And he seems to really like me. I haven't seen you this excited about anyone in a long time. This is my little secret. You can't tell anyone. Hi. Where are you? Paul? Why are you then? Not now. Every New Year's you made a resolution to stop. But it never happens, Paul. After all of this, you're still my favorite person in the world. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and I want our relationship to be forever. I want to be with you forever. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and I want our relationship to make me feel stronger. Are you finished? Paul's a grown-up. He's going to work it out, or he's not, but you're not going to save him. You never were, and you aren't now. He said that I had ruined his life, and that he wasn't going to stay. We're not having sex. No! I'll come home tomorrow. You shouldn't leave now. I'm not leaving."
100032," This humble room is my studio. These are drawings from the first season of Pee Wee's Playhouse. I designed most of the puppets on the show. Here's my man, Dirty Dog. I wanted him to have his butt hanging out of his mouth that they wouldn't let us. It's a kid's show. But I became Randy. Yeah, smokin' is cool, Pee Wee. This is a prop from the Smashing Pumpkins video. Whoa! This is Peter Gabriel big time video. This is what happens when you get all proud of yourself and you're polishing your Emmy. Hehehehehehehe. Oh my Emmy! I've worn a lot of different hats. Painter, sculptor, cartoonist, puppeteer, set designer, art director, animator, illustrator. Kids mainlined it. He was imprinting their brain and they don't even know it. The little Zach Galifianakis, the little Snuffy Smith, the little Unibomber. Wayne has touched people in ways that they don't even know. My mission is to bring humor into fine art. Ladies and gentlemen, the world's largest George Jones head. I think when you're an artist, you want to put your stuff out there just because of the exuberance of being creative and then you feel bad about yourself. So I see that in Wayne's work. Beauty is embarrassing. It's beautiful out here. It's so beautiful it hurts my feelings. I saw Wayne's first New York show and I was astonished. It really just blew me away and I had to find out more about it and him. This is called Sexy Paintings by Sexy Painters for Sexy People. And I always love that there's a little teeny ghost of the red underpaintings. There's nothing amateurish about anything that he does. I learned that art could be a 24-7 lifestyle. I learned that art could be fun. I've been trying to make beauty my whole life. If this can work, there's hope for us all. I want to try everything I can. I want to take this painting idea and see if you can do a puppet version of it. I want to take the cartooning and turn it into a set. I want to take the set and turn it back into a painting. That's a true pioneer. That's a person who is never satisfied, always wants to know how do I understand myself more. Ladies and gentlemen, Wayne White. Do what you love. It's going to lead to where you want to go."
100034," I'm going to try. No. She does maybe never hurt the body though. She's been more fat. Oh, oh, she really? Yeah. There's some cute girls, huh? There's some nice ones. Wow. They love skinny girls in Japan. She has a fresh, young face. She looks young, almost like a pubescent girl. Say hello, Nadia. Hello, my name is Nadia. I'm 13. So I look at beauty and I think of young girls, beautiful. Many, many questions, but don't answer. I don't hear her answer. Why?"
100083," You're black, they're white, this ain't hockey. There's something I want to ask you. There's something I'd like to ask you. Will you f*** on me? I want you to be my first. Truth or dare? Dare. See that blonde kid over there? I dare you to blow out escandals before he gets a chance to. They homeschool their son. It's very important to us that Kevin has a normal and complete high school experience. You dropped your books, fart face. Hey guys! Come check out this kid's weird... Wow. Why didn't you call me?

We're just gonna have to plug it up. I got frozen peas and a sponge. Oh no! No no no no. I can't believe you had sex with that hobo from Magic Bean. He was a wizard! Now I understand. Just when I thought it couldn't get more offensive. Boom! How many times do I have to tell you? You're black, they're white! So coach what you're saying is we just walk with the Lord. The Lord! You did his part already! He made you black!"
100159," Show me your world, Chris. Well, I thought we'd start with Christchurch Museum. Great. Dear Mum, Yorkshire is lovely, not like you said at all. They can smile and they do sell my pasta sauce. The caravan made is quite short, but Chris is a sensitive lover. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Hope you can be happy for me. Love, Tina. Yeah, good girl. You are going to pick that up. I didn't do that. If you don't pick up this excrement immediately, then I'm going to have to inform the National Trust. Ooh! Report that to the National Trust, mate. I don't want this to ruin our holiday. Get in. I've never thought about murdering innocent people before. He's not a person, Tina, he's a daily mail reader. Say one word and it's... Sorry. I get it, it's just thinking outside the box. They're worth tears and that's nothing. Oh, saint of love... The police are pursuing a ginger-faced man and an angry woman. Ah! Sit! You're a liability.

100304," From an executive producer of Snatch. For a guy to get along in this world, you have to be very, very careful. So where are we off to? I'll let you know when we get there. Our targets. Mr. Gleaters, why don't you come out and talk to me? There are rules. Try not to look in his eyes. Think of somebody you hate so much, you'd be willing to kill it. There are no mistakes.

100365," There's a way you feel when you know you're unwanted. That's how I feel. I have to pretend to be what I'm not. I told him that if I'm with you then I feel as if you're supposed to be my wife. There's no longer a debate in Uganda. We don't recognise homosexuality as a human right here. The anti-homosexuality bill which was tabled in parliament proposes life imprisonment for gay activity and death for aggravated homosexuality. Homosexuals, they eat each other's rectum. They eat their poo-poo. Americans and Europeans. They want us to eat their poison of homosexuality. We're saying no. I received another letter from the Archbishop. The Diocese do launch a vigorous crusade against all forms of homosexuality. When the religious white people from America came, they claimed that we are recruiting young children in schools. It's when they formed the anti-gay coalition. It's the rainbow. It's our colours. I'm the very first gay man to be open in Uganda. I'm a chapter professional. I went to one of the best schools and here I am. I was like, I'm attracted to women. I'm infected with HIV. AIDS. What the hell is this? He used to find me doing something with a girl. And he was like, no, that is not right. I'm going to teach you what you're supposed to do with a boy. I would swallow the heap of heels. I wanted to die softly. There is this woman now, is she a creature? Is she a human being really? It was at the comments of the people. The first outing which came up in the papers was 2007, where we had this list of the top homosexual men in Kampala. They mentioned the location where I live. Actually, I remember I cried. I cried, yeah. If this bill passes, they say within 24 hours, someone should report the person who used to be gay. We are really going back into our ministerial regime. We are going to keep on fighting until we see a liberated, deep lesbian, gays, bisexual, transgender people in the United States. If what they're doing is in for... It's not in for. The ones I've met are naturally a born homosexuals. Now we are pushed to dialogue by force. We will hold this action for enforcement of these human rights. I know he is struggling, but people like David can come out and speak. Sooner or later, they will be free. Prime Minister Gordon Brown came to see me. And what was he talking about? Gays. Mrs. Clinton rang me. What was she talking about? Gays. I sleep here alone. Sometimes I fear if they come and get me, I will be alone. Being gay does not mean that God is not in me. He is in me. I see his love. If we are against the oppressed, they may think God is also against it, which is not true. We will stand for the truth. This call today that shows that indeed justice is possible in this country. And we will continue. Now we have to keep on fighting. We know what you want. Bye bye. Arrabbiata. Yesterday, gay rights activist David Katotisulu was attacked at his home by a non-assailant. David is killed! The woman who killed us, the woman who died, we will kill her! We are coming here to take our friend to his creator. Who are you to judge? God did not punish David Katot. People murdered him falsely in the name of God. Blue Angle Scott Liveley, there is blood on your hands. It's a reality. Somebody spilled his blood, his brains. The mattress. Letters from Obama are not enough. As we grieve, we can't forget that we've been empowered through the death of David. We will work to take back this struggle. It's time for us to fight. We all want to know our stories. That's why we decided to come out, no matter what. They kept on saying we are not here. But of it, we are here. You know, the synonym of the queers here, K-U-C-H-U. K-U-C-H-U"

My husband comes and says, just kill her. Yeah, just kill her. I held her, I said, this girl will make me proud. Bye, goodbye, I said, and I walked off. Should we go with the old world or should we go with the new world? There are a lot of things that are right for me, which are wrong for my family. But they need to understand I've been born in the 21st century. We do something like this. India will never take this. Bye, bye.

100745," Hi, my name is Simon and I'm the director of The Pirate Bay away from keyboard, a feature documentary about the founders of the world's largest file sharing site. Right now it's a really exciting time. We're one month away from the Court of Appeal hearings in Stockholm, Sweden and I'm in Southeast Asia following the story. A couple of years ago I accidentally ran into Broken, one of the three founders of The Pirate Bay. Over a cup of coffee he told me how the White House had threatened the Swedish government because of his and his buddies hobby homepage. He told me how The Pirate Bay had tried to buy an island to create a nation of their own without copyright laws. He also told me about The Pirate Bay's involvement with Wikileaks. I was totally amazed by the stories Brokeup told me and at that point I hadn't even met the other two founders. When I finally did meet Tiamo, Anakata and Brokeup and saw them in the same room together, I realized that the real story here is between them within the context of the global copyright conflict. I've been following this story for almost two years now. Right now I'm sitting on over 200 hours of incredible footage. This is where I need your help. In the past I've edited myself but with this amazing story I want to find a great editor that can help me tell a complex story in the best possible way. The money I raise here would go to hire a professional editing studio and an editor. A lot of people keep asking me how can you make a movie about The Pirate Bay when they're killing your own business as a filmmaker. They say that file sharing is killing creativity. Well to me the answer is simple. I don't believe in it. I believe in finding new ways of rewarding culture. This is one such way. Help me prove them wrong. Thank you for watching."

101106," When we showed up at Sound City, what is this place? Because I don't know that we could make a record in here. Whatever happened, you are rock and roll. When you walk into Sound City, you'd love it or hate it. It looks kind of dumpy. Brown shag carpet on the wall, that's the kind of thing that you would do to your van. But walking down the hallway and seeing all of those platinum records on the wall, that's what I'm talking about. Tom Petty. Fleetwood Mac. Neil Young, man. Cheap trick. Chili Peppers. Pat Benatar. Guns N' Roses. Nine of Snails. Floor and Error. Rats. Johnny Cash. Metallica. Dude, how many of these albums have been made there? We chose Sound City because Nevermind was recorded there. This guy, Rupert Neve, designed these next generation consoles. There's only four like this in the world. There's something about the Neve sound. It's a pretty badass console. When you came to work at Sound City, it was a tape-based studio. You knew what you were getting. Sound City was a place where real men went to make records. All during the 80s, you listened to one of these stations where they played rock and roll. Seven or eight out of ten songs were recorded at Sound City. I was wondering whoever used the board after us if they had a burning sensation the next morning. Then they'd know we were there. Other studios started to shift. Everything's got to be digital. Now you can record audio into the computer. I heard some young guy in a band say, you don't have to practice anymore. You just slice it up in the computer and it comes out perfectly. Sound City, it just couldn't keep up. It started selling off the gear in Studio B. I thought that board would just go straight to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I'm trying to move on, but it's been hard. Like many things, there's no bookstore, there's no music store, and there's no Sound City. In this age of technology, where you can manipulate anything, how do we retain that human element? Let's rock, let's play, let's record. Be true to yourself and make the music that you love. Chemistry is something that happens between people. The conversation became something much bigger. How do we keep music to sound like people? It sort of like evolves until it hits this point and maybe goes... ..."

They're calling him the future of magic. This guy's a magician. He doesn't even have a costume. I'm sure you've seen people walk on red hot coals. But I doubt you've seen anyone spend the night on red hot coals. You need to do something fresh. So this is where old entertainers go to die. And so I'm not so old. May I see that for a minute?

What are you feeling right now? That's why you became a magician. How did you do that? I was partially deboned. What you do is not magic.

You will remember me. Jackie Robinson. A black man in white baseball. I want you to know I'm there for you. And my heart. Think about the abuse that he's gonna take. Your enemy will be out in force but you cannot meet him on his own low ground. What you gonna do if one of these pictures throws through your head? I'll duck. Mark my words and circle this day, Negroes are gonna run the white man straight out of baseball. This ain't the America I know. You hear me? If they knew you, they would be ashamed.

101904," What do you want out of life? I don't know. To be happy? To be happy. I want the American dream. I want to be happy. The professor said to me, you can never measure happiness. And why they thought you could measure depression, which they were all doing, but you couldn't measure happiness, I'm not sure. This is a paradise to me. That's why I love it so much.

It was incredibly free. Come on now, give me that chocolate mousse. Red. It's alright, it's alright. Red. It's alright. It's not alright, in fact. Something happened in Acton Baby. That was the pivot point. We started out doing the same thing that we'd always done. We'd just bash it out. Listen back and not like anything that we were doing. We were on completely different pages. The fact that the Berlin Wall had come down, that was pretty powerful stuff. We were building our own wall in Hansa Studios. There's an environment out of which music grows. There's a kind of faith that's necessary to move from one note to the other. Suddenly, something happens and you know it. Suddenly, something happens and you know it. It was one of those hairs on the back of your neck moments. Making Acton Baby was the reason we're still here now. It wasn't that we found a sonic identity, we found a spiritual identity. That was what we actually needed. We still were in music because it could be fun and because it could go places you shouldn't be allowed to go. And we carried each other to the point where we could stand on our own feet. We were in the same room. We were in the same room. We were in the same room. We were in the same room. We were in the same room. We were in the same room. We were in the same room.

We grab him, sign a few signatures. We give him a protein shake. He doesn't even know what happened. I watch a lot of movies, Paul. I know what I'm doing.

Do you really need to make $40,000 a year just to teach some kids how to clap their hands and run around in a circle? Hey. Ah! Did you tell them I was in your class in 2006? Jason Sherwood? Yeah. What are you doing here? I thought you lived in New York. Who uses pepper spray in Kingston? I thought you'd be tearing up Broadway by now. I, uh, call my thesis play. It's a very, very personal story. Jason, what if there were a way to get it produced right now? Oh, that's so extraordinary. I feel like I've been transformed. This is not a high school play. This is from a man who thinks American Buffalo is about an American buffalo. That's what it's called. Well, in the words of David Mamet, Time out! Jason, I need to talk to you outside. We are rehearsing. Excuse me. I'm going to talk to my son now. You know what? He's a bully, and someone needs to tell him that he's wrong. Oh, no. Because of the play, we must be professional. Right.

102378," This product is image in a can. This product could be sneakers or T-shirts or glow-in-the-dark headbands. It's not about the fluid, it's about the image. The success depends on people being shallow, superficial, and desperate for attention. This is the American dream in a can. The first thing you learn in business school is that you need a market yourself. I'm assuming you're after the young, cynical, image-conscious consumer? Exactly. It'll be like drinking irony. You learn to analyze love as if it were a tool to sell a product. She sells herself better than anyone I've ever met. I live in Times Square with my girlfriend. I'm in love. You, my friend, are in love with an image. Mr. P, this is scat. With rivalry always comes motivation to succeed. Senior management loves sneaky Pete. Rumor has it they're grooming him to be the next VP. Why do you like Six so much? It's because you're like, all pushed around. There's not one thing genuine about her. You know that she's not even a real lesbian, right? Sex is biology. Sex appeal is marketing. We take image very seriously. I'm finding you very attractive right now. Looking at a billboard is supposed to feel like love at first sight, but it's not real. It's just marketing. What does this product taste like? As long as this thing tastes better than urine, people are literally going to convince themselves that they like it. Actually, people can believe they like the taste of urine. Really? We tested it once."

We were born different from you. It's in our blood. Nothing that you do or dream up can ever change that. Shut up! Gatsby, he had a grand vision for his life since he was a boy. I'm gonna fix things just the way they were before. Just you and me. No amount of fire could challenge the fairy tale he had stored up in his heart. Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful? Is all this made entirely from your own imagination? But I had the uneasy feeling that he was guarding secrets. I wish I'd done everything on earth with you. I don't wanna go home. Then don't. It had gone beyond her. It had gone beyond everything. Something ought to be done about a fella like that.

You do realize this is a game. Played out on a global scale. Vegas was just a start. This trick was designed a long time ago. We are dealing with something far bigger than us.

Singing background remains a, I suppose, a somewhat unheralded position, you know. There's a power to these women that stand on stage with these guys. It's a bit of a walk. That walk to the front is, is complicated. Can you turn off the radio? How could you logically not have a diva have her music on? I don't get that. The rock and roll people like Bruce and Elton John and Stevie wanted to know who that girl singer was. My life has been all about trying to make a success of the gift that I had. She was like the really hot one of the IKITs. She was very hot. Beautiful girl. I don't set out to be the sex symbol, but you post and playboy. My greatest pleasure is to stand back and let them do what they can do. When you're a background singer, it is a springboard, but it can easily become a quicksand if that's not what you want to do. There's no guarantees in entertainment. I've got dreams. Rocks dreams. I felt like if I just gave my heart to what I was doing, I would automatically be a star. It got so bad, I started cleaning houses. I just looked up and said, okay, you're supposed to be singing. There's a whole world out there who wants to hear you sing. Leave it on me. When you're at the top. They're in the game and they stayed in the game and they're legends. It is my honor to induct into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and about time to Miss Darlie Love. Somebody to lead on me. Leave it on me. When you're at the top. I'll be your queen. I'll be your queen. I'll be your queen."

The world's end. What do we do? Let's finish our drinks."
103372," Sir, I don't understand. I've closed more cases than any agent here at the FBI. She's a tight-ass federal agent. You're skilled, but you're not a team player. None of the other agents like you win for my recount. One, two. Unbelievable. She's a badass Boston cop. Hey, look who's here. Right into my mousetrap. Run, she's crazy. From Paul Feig, the director of Bridesmaids. I think this individual might be mentally ill. No, no, no, just work with her. She is the best cop. Motherfucker! The FBI has jurisdiction. No, not in there. Will you stop? No, not in there. Knock it off, Mullins. What is she doing? She's looking for my balls. Hey, if anyone sees the captain's balls, let me know. They're about this big. They're like really, really tiny little girl balls. Have little girls had balls? Now, the hardest thing they'll have to do. Don't approach me if I'm not expecting you. Is work together. I'm going to need this. I'm a trained interviewer. Or we could go in and beat him with a phone book. You just need to be patient. Who does that? Hank Lessoie. Got tons of ties to the drug world. There he is. You don't fit in. I'm a federal agent. Really? Because you look like you're going to set up a table and do their fucking taxes. What are those? Stop it. They're spanks. They hold everything together. Why? What's going to come fucking popping out? No, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes. No, no, you said that thing ticks. Yeah, but not for days. Surprise. I can't lift him up. What? Lift my ass up. Ah. Ah. Our car. The middle car broke his fall, right? Yeah. Let's shake it off. Sandra Bullock. It's the way we do it on the streets. Word. Don't do slang. It's like watching a nun make out. It's uncomfortable. Melissa McCarthy. Nice guy. I'm going to be a good friend. Nice big one for you, sweetheart. Who is that? My mom. No cell phones. How about now? Oh, different story. Let's loosen that up. The Heat. That was pretty awesome. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend. I'm going to be a good friend.

103384," I want to show you something. From the time of Alexander the Great, no man could travel faster than the horse that carried him. Not anymore. Imagine time and space under the mastery of man. Power that makes emperors and kings look like fools. Whoever controls this controls the future. There come a time, Kimo Sabe. One good man must wear a mask."
103444," I don't think there is anybody like Woody. I've never met anybody like Woody. You can't compare anybody to Woody Allen. His range is amazing. You have only to look at bananas and match points. If you'd asked me what directors I'd wanted to work with, Woody Allen would have been at the top of my list. He is, with that question, the best actor's director I've ever worked with. Not everybody has the staying power, not everybody has the tenacity, and not everybody has so much to say. The day that he finishes editing a film is the day he starts typing the script of the next. He never takes any time off. 14 screenplay nominations. 14. Who the hell is good for 20 years? This guy's been good for 40 years. He's kind of peerless. It's not just that we're still interested in Woody Allen, he's still interested in telling stories. On the one hand he'd be brilliant and his insights were amazing, but on the other hand he'd be an idiot. He's also not normal, you know, he's not of the normal stock. Neurosis, fears, phobias. A bit adolescent to tell you the truth. He is a little bit of a hypochondriac. He's cripplingly shy. Oh, he's definitely a little nutty. Woody really wears his heart on his sleeve. He's a big hugger. No. I remember it when Woody was the Antichrist. And by the way, the one thing that I didn't mention is that he's also very funny. So much of what's filtered out about me over the years has been completely mythological, completely exaggerated or downright untrue. And some of it's been true, of course."
103502," I'm getting married today! By the end of today I'm going to be Mrs. Alexander Cristina Fernandez. At the end of the day he's going to be Mr. Giddings, whatever he turns into his bed. It's going to be the perfect day. Are you going to do it and make babies? When did you hear about that? No more pranks. Jenny, it's forced, it's the man pieces. I have good news and bad news. So what's the good news? Yeah, I'm proud to say I'm 50% married. I think she broke my toe. I promise there will be no more mishaps for the rest of the day. If anyone knows any reason why these two people should not be married... What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah. Bring it! I don't wear panties anymore so I'm always ready. Oh my ass! She's definitely better than the girls in this bed this morning. I just want to find my wife and get married. No matter what I do, I get so much more from you. Because when I say I love you, you say I love you too. You say I love you too. Don't see any of us getting married too. We're real men."

That's all I was gonna say. Nice to meet you, Amy. What's your story? I don't really have any stories. What do you mean? Everyone's got a story. I don't know. I'd like to think that there's more to a person than just one thing. You know, I gotta tell you, Sutter, Amy Finnecke is just a strange choice for a rebound. You're 17 years old. You don't have the next boyfriend? No. Really? Sutter, guys don't look at me like that. That's shocking. Yeah, absolutely guys look at you like that. No, no, no. And if she falls for you, what happens then? Should we take our shirts off? Okay. My sister and she's having this like fancy dinner party. Would you want to go with me? Yeah, what time? It's ten minutes. Oh, ten minutes from now? Yeah. I think it's good to have dreams, don't you? To dreams. I'll tell you something, I don't live in the past. I live in the now because that's what it's all about. You know, everyone's telling me I gotta move on. I don't see what's so great about being an adult. Are you happy? You're not the joke everyone thinks, man. I love you. You don't love me. Yes, I do. I kind of thought she'd be the one to yank you out of neutral. You don't see that I'm bad for you? You need to get away from me. You have the biggest heart of anyone I know. I love these people. I do, I love these people. I love you all. This right here, this is beautiful. This is the youngest that we're ever gonna be. This is our time, live in the now. Cheers. Cheers. To you, Amy Finnegan. To you, Sarah Kueh."
103543," I'm not happy. I just need some time out. I'm gonna move back in with you guys. You're 30 years old. I'm 29. I'm 29. I have a plan. I'm gonna lifeguard. Don't skimp on the cleaning.

What is wrong with you? You came in at 3 o'clock in the morning. You're my friend and I let you suck me down this rabbit hole. You have your whole life ahead of you.

104726," Whenever I would fly home, there was the city of New York laid out before me, and I thought to myself, this belongs to me. Ha ha ha ha. In 1977, the city was on the verge of bankruptcy. Businesses were leaving, families were leaving, anybody who could leave would. Good morning, I'm Ed Koch, and I'm running for mayor, and I need your help. How am I doing? Here was a guy who really represented the rough and tumble of New York, and he was just haunted and damned by one hell of a personality. Shut up, will you, and let me talk to these people? I knew that of all those who were running, I knew more than they did. We want that! There was a sense of momentum building. At the same time, so did the rumors. There were signs in all the trains, vote for Cuomo, not the homo. Why have you never married? Well, I've always thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to be married and race in the main street? You have to get attention of the public. You've got to get them to follow you. And you can only do that by being bigger than life. It's me! He's a national figure. What he says matters on everything. The last time I was in a crowded elevator, I peed on the governor. Koch has lived his life in the public. Am I doing all right? Thank you. Hi, everybody! That is his family. I think it's his oxygen. The assumption was mayors capitulate. Koch said no. And it was a word that most New Yorkers had not heard before. It doesn't move me. It doesn't change me. In his third term, this is where the tide turned on. We're dying. The city is dying. There was no medication whatsoever, which was a total nightmare. His government looked as corrupt as any government ever had. I went into a state of depression. He saw it all slipping away. Well, you think I was a crook? I can't bear that. He created a second life for himself. He's been a political force. He still enjoys the battle. People would say, oh, you must run again. You must run again. And I would say, no. People threw me out. And now the people must be punished. And people love that. I still say it occasionally. How am I doing? I'm a man of my word. I'm a man of my word. I'm a man of my word. I still say it occasionally. How am I doing? Thank you. Am I doing all right?"

If I put you in the White House, I'd puke on you! He was. Take no prisoners. Provoke confrontations. Later! This is not Oprah, this is not Phil. This is Morton Downey. Get out of here! My audience finally selected a spokesman that identifies with their needs and with their dreams and with their frustrations. He's not afraid to open his mouth. He's not afraid of anybody. He has what you can only describe in his audience as a lynch mob. Should we hang this kid? You'll get some! You have no remorse right now! Hannity, Riley, Glenn Beck. They're not as crude as Mort was, but they are appealing to that same audience. Mort understood performance, how you turn everything into something theatrical. I said to myself, this has gone too far now. Often, the self-destructive people, really entertaining. He rose like a rocket and he fell like a stick. I didn't like seeing that side of him, I guess, because that's not the person I was raised with. He was never like that unless he was on camera. Why don't you shut up? Why don't you shut up? Mort's legacy is passion plays on television, even if it's an act. Which is what all the reality shows today are based on. If you're not tethered to the facts, you can just say anything. You weren't quite sure whether it was all set up or whether some of it was set up or whether it was all real. Is this a passing fancy or is this the front of the wave?

105429," Now, the thing you ought to know about this Mini Cooper is it is small. We are in proportion, me and my car. My name is Robert Reich. I was secretary of labor under Bill Clinton. Before that, the Carter administration. Before that, I was a special aide to Abraham Lincoln. Of all developed nations, the United States has the most unequal distribution of income and we're surging toward even greater inequality. 1928 and 2007 become the peak years for income concentration. It looks like a suspension bridge. Last year we made $36,000. I think I'd probably make $50,000 a year working 70 hours a week. The middle class is struggling. People occasionally say to me, what nation does it better? The answer is the United States. In the decades after World War II, the economy boomed, but you had very low inequality. You know Robert Reich? I do. He's a communist. When I was a kid, bigger boys would pick on me. I think it changed my life. I had to protect people from the people who would beat them up economically. Who is actually looking out for the American worker? The answer is nobody. If the workers don't have power, if they don't have a voice, their wages and benefits start eroding. We are losing equal opportunity in America. Any one of you who feels cynical, just consider where we have been."

106111," Honestly, though, I didn't prepare that well, because that's just the way I do it. I don't believe in preparing. I personally don't really like preparers. Um... They're annoying people, generally. Like, you know, what's like, hey, I really prepared for this. Well, you're a coward. You know, why don't... Where's your sense of adventure? How important is it that you... Like, you know, why set yourself up for that? You know what I mean? Everyone's career is culture, you know? This sort of, like, trajectory thing, you know? It's gonna kill you. You're gonna end up lonely at the end and not doing what you want to do. Don't prepare, man. Just load up. In my mind, if I don't prepare and I pull this off, I'm a fucking genius. I'm a genius. Right? And if I don't pull it off, I didn't prepare. If I would have set my mind to it, I would have nailed that shit. But, no, I didn't prepare, because I like to roll the dice, man. I feel alive. What's gonna happen? I don't know. I might fail. All right, fuck them. That would be you. I'm not gonna blame myself for that."
106144," Hi, I'm Brian Trenchard-Smith and this is Trailers from Hell. I made the trailer for the 1969 Ken Loach movie Kes, a classic by which all future British social realist dramas would be measured. Fifty years on, this film is very much in the Kes style, realist yet lyrical, as it depicts the effects of poverty on childhood in post-Thatcher northern England. It's the brainchild of experimental filmmaker and academic Cleo Barnard, whose encounters with actual teenage scrap metal scavengers, some as young as 11, inspired her to make a film about this subculture. Her other inspiration is Oscar Wilde's fable about childhood lost and regained, The Selfish Giant. Like Kes, friendship and love for an animal is at the heart of this film. Kes was about a boy and a bird, this is two boys and a horse. Arbor and Swiftie are lifelong friends trapped in dysfunctional families. The volatile Arbor, afflicted with ADHD, has his medication regularly stolen. The more resigned Swiftie lives with seven siblings in a house with irregular electricity and no furniture because their father keeps selling it. They decide to earn their way out of this oppressive existence by picking up scrap with a horse and cart and selling it to a local scrap dealer, a manipulative petty criminal who soon talks them into an illegal and dangerous activity, well known in the UK, stealing copper wire from railway tracks. Lacking good adult role models, both boys compete for the approval of this monster, straining their relationship and pushing them towards ever riskier thefts. The decaying industrial estates of West Yorkshire provide a perfect setting for capitalism at the bottom of the food chain. It's the remarkable performances by first time actors Connor Chapman and David Bradley that make the film so compelling. There's a scene of emotional meltdown that is so searingly real it put a lump in my throat. Yet Ms Barnard never strays into melodrama. It's all observed with clinical detachment, devoid of sentimentality. These shots come from a tense but darkly humorous scene of illegal harness racing on a main road, another UK subculture Ms Barnard explores. She defines her style as less cinema verite, more cinema verbatim. The strong regional accents required subtitles for its American release. Check it out at a digital platform near you. It sounds depressing, but in fact The Selfish Giant is a rewarding film. It stays with you. I'll break me. Shall I?"
106236," You have this plant, you know, for thousands and thousands of years. I mean, people have been dedicating their life to make something amazing out of it. It is living art, and you can't appreciate it until you consume it. It's a lot more than just grape juice. It's a drug, really. Salmoneys are professionals that are supposedly experts about knowing about beverage and wine. Salms now have become the new rock stars in the industry. Some of the most dedicated, obsessed people. So there's this diploma called the Master Sommelier Diploma. It's the highest achievement you can make in the world of wine. Over 40 years, there's only been like 170 in the world. I cried when my parents died. I cried when my children were born. The only other time outside of that that I cried was when I passed this exam. I've got to know every single one on the planet. It's pretty amazing the amount of information you have to know. The regions, the subregions, the districts, the villages, it's in five languages. Why certain years were good, how to serve it, what to eat with every different kind of wine. Nothing else in my life has ever been as difficult. Well, nobody ever said that anything that you worked hard for was going to be easy. When someone tells you this is something that a lot of people can't do, people either go, wow, that's impressive, or they say, wow, I want to do that. Perhaps to the detriment of your marriage or your relationship. You have to be sickly gifted. Perfect. Ego maniacs. Completely obsessed. If you're really serious, if you really want to become an MS, you can't do it alone. They're like guys in a locker room, you know, with wine bottles. So why don't you tell me how to taste them? I mean, ****. Do you look like Michael Douglas in Falling Down? I'm sure that as the week goes on, it'll probably just get worse. Is this happening right now? I don't know, you tell me. Oh, falling apart here. Absolutely brutal. This sucks. I told myself I can be him, I have to be him, I will be him."
106330," Hello? Hey, it's Billy. Billy! How you doing? What's going on? I got something important here, alright? I'm getting married. What? Uh, wow. To that young lady who's half your age? Hey, wait, wait, wait. She's almost 32. I have a hemorrhoid that's almost 32. So we're going to have a bester party in Vegas? I can't smoke, drink, eat, salt or stay out past 9, but... Alright, I love it! Prop is sweltering in here. Maybe I should just stay home. No, you don't have to do that. Your only job is to relax. Hmm, hmm.さやкам. Oh, God. What the hell are you doing here? Billy is tying me up in Vegas. If you think I'm going to Vegas from that selfish bastard, you're dumber than that hat. Welcome to Las Vegas. Relax, it's not like you invented it. How many times I gotta say I'm sorry? You can't say it enough. Sorry boys, then it was a joke. Knock it off! I'm gonna go find some damn water and take all my damn pills. Then we're gonna get this damn party started. Is this man's bachelor party? Hey, you know who's supposed to be staying here this weekend? 50. P-50? No, 50. There are people in there? 50 Cent, 50. Curtis Jackson, the rapper. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, from the Jackson 5. There are girls in every bar. I want all of you to get in trouble. Which one of you is Sam Harris? You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me. Tonight we're gonna party like it's 1959. Bring out the bottles! I'm getting married. She's your age. You must be rich. Yeah, but you should be talking to me. Come on. Hey buddy, maybe you had too much to drink, huh? If I want your opinion, I'll just beat it at you. Sure. No one calls us names except for us. I owe you this one. Whoa! Wow! We got a couple of unresolved issues. Bring out the bottles! Oh, I've been this hungover in 30 years. Everything's spinning. I know."
106332," What is it about Muscle Shoals? It's just a little village on the Alabama border. Why does that music come out of there? At different points in time on this planet, there are certain places where there is a field of energy. Those guys that sit there in that studio, they just fire the group. It doesn't happen very often. It's usually somebody like Rick Hall with the drive and the foresight to do it. I want it to be special. I want it to be somebody. I remember when Paul Simon called Stax Records, talked to Al Bell. He said, hey man, I want those same black players that played on I'll Take You There. He said, that can happen, but these guys are mighty pale. We started to explode. The world was coming to Muscle Shoals. Being there does inspire you to do it slightly differently. It was pretty funky, you know. That was the whole idea of it. I began to tell them of this great new deal we'd made with Capital. One of the guys stopped me and said, we've already made a deal with Jerry. We'll be leaving here. It was war. You're going to hear some of the greatest voices that ever were. You're in Rock and Roll Hand, man."
106441," I don't have a family or even a place to call home. I never understood the meaning of the word hope, but I'm about to meet the people who will change all that. Come. Meet your new parents. Your majesty. From now on you call me mama, yeah? And that lazy pig over there, you call him papa. Your first book. Are you sure this is yours? It wasn't always mine. Can't you even read the book? I'm not sure I can. I'm not sure I can. I'm not sure I can. I'm not sure I can. I'm not sure I can. I'm not sure I can. It wasn't always mine. Can't you even read yet? Go on, read one word. I'm not such a good reader myself, you know. We will have to help each other out. I have something very important to tell you, listen. Who is he, papa? His name's Max. He needs help. I need you to promise me that you will not tell anyone. Is that your book? It wasn't always mine. Mama, they're coming. They're checking basements. If anyone saw him, they would take you away from me. And they cannot tell you what they will do to him. Words will inspire her. If your eyes could speak, what would they say? Courage will guide her. You're hiding someone, aren't you? Can we trust her? She's a child. She's our daughter. Hope will define her. I can't lose someone else. You've kept me alive. Don't ever forget that. You're stealing books? Why? The knife robs you. Sometimes you have to rob it back. Words are life, Lisa. All those pages, they're for you to fill."
106452," The general idea was to just shoot it from one angle and just try and work things around that and including people leaving the shot and being on the edge of the shot. The good thing was that because we didn't have this kind of usual industrial kind of moving of lights around and just shooting the script, each scene was the thing in itself. So this is the frame, this is the angle and this is the actions and then just let's sculpt within this, rather than let's cover the scene from various angles. But what I did do a lot of was just kind of several takes and reframing slightly, sometimes even changing the lighting, working the performance, adding lines, taking away lines. So within this one set up, you could really sculpt it and sometimes it was like take 26 that where everything came together or sometimes take two. In framing, how did you come up with that? It was partly the result of just kind of looking how to make this four by three work in certain type of shots because it's a great format for portraits and double portraits but sometimes it just felt very kind of heavy and square and I just said, you know, what happens if we just tilt up and have just more space above their heads and it looked interesting and you know, with the young DLP, Wukash Jal, we just kind of pushed further and further and just got completely carried away to the point where we just had some shots where I started thinking, what if we have subtitles? Of course, you know, the subtitles will cancel out all the human activity. So we put the... You put the subtitles on top. Yeah, which people think it was designed like that, it was just a desperation measure."

107042," I want to be able to stand in the back of the house and be proud of what I see, not just in terms of my own work, but say, yes, that musical was worth spending a year and a half of your life on. The songs I write don't really reflect me. They all are about getting into those characters that the book writer has made. Once I get a scene, I sometimes will put the scene on the easel of the piano and just improvise at the piano, just reading the dialogue. You must not write because you think it's going to be a hit, because it's expedient. The only reason to write is from love."

Roll the dice. Second that they run down there, we got 200 on our backs. Two, we terminate the compromise. We cannot do that. I don't think so. If we do two, you can't do it. It's impossible. What are you talking about? We have to do it. Who's going to do it? I'm going to get it. It's not like you're playing with fire. You're not going to do it. You're not going to get it.

107083," You're nervous, I can tell. Relax. What's wrong? Trish is so hot and she's into you. Yeah, I know, but she's too clingy. And everyone at school thinks that we had sex. Yeah, I don't see what's wrong with that. We got a nickname for you, son. Flash. That was incredible. Thanks. I have a dad that is pressuring me into going to Yale and living the same life that he did. That includes having a wife. I know people laugh at me, I'm not stupid. I don't want the whole school knowing about me. For real. I don't want to be gay. I just want to be normal. We get to be ourselves here. Shouldn't we let other kids have that same thing? This isn't a geography club. We're like a secret support group. For what? For gay teens. I mean, I did tell her that I was 80-20, but she didn't mind. 80-20? 80% straight, 20% gay.

107314," I will get out. And whoever you are, I will find you. The original movie was a real favorite of mine. People forget that the original source of Old Boy is a Japanese illustrated novel. Old Boy tells the story of Joe Doucette. One day he wakes up in a motel room that is a prison cell. Hello! Can anybody hear me on the outside? He has no idea why he has been put there, who put him there, and spends the next 20 years of his life there. What kind of research do you do and what's being in prison like? Let's spend three days in solitary confinement. You know you're getting out, so you'll never be able to have that feeling to not know when you're getting out. Would it destroy you or would it alter you into someone different? Josh has a place that was locked away for a long time and then it's rust out. There's such an element of mystery to it. Very nebulous and very strange. Hello? Hello, Joseph. Answer these questions. Who am I and why did I imprison you for 20 years? The Stranger tells Joe we must accept the consequences of every deed throughout our lifetime. Old Boy is the ultimate version of someone having to deal with their actions. It's a roller coaster of a film that is hard to compare to any other film. Joe Doucette revered back to those add-on instincts in all of us. You ready? Josh Bowling went there. Cut! My man! It's an experience and that's what I want going to the movies. I want to be moved. I've never seen this before, like the actor's actually getting hit. Anything goes. It's just wide open. It's the most difficult thing I've ever done. Hey, Joe! I want people to feel so punched in the gut, their jaws drop. I never stop to ask the most fundamental question of all. Why did I let you go?"
107348," Hello. Hello. Hello. Here we go. For one week only. I like this! What? Beginning February 28th. Quit yanking our crotch hoses. Anchorman 2 is making its epic return to theaters with 763 due jokes. Cap or decap? Why? I need to know how I'm gonna make your coffee tomorrow morning when you wake up in my pants. It's longer. You just want more and more and more and more and more and more. Crazier. Ah! Ah! Ah! And now it's Rated R. Ron, tell me what this looks like. Okay, brick. It's live television. I'm gonna take out my real one. No, no, no, no, no. That's right. 763 new jokes. That's the gay way. Anchorman 2. The legend continues. Super-sized R-rated version with 763 new jokes. Yay!"
107382," I know you think you're going to hear some jokes. Well, Mom don't know nothing. But I can tell you some facts. I don't know whether it was the voice. Maybe you look good to me. Or the clothes. There was something about her. You laughed because it was naughty. When them big cots come running over me, don't you know you went through a red light? I said, ""'Cause I seen all you white folks going on the green light, I thought the red light was for her."" When I was listening to it, I didn't know that she was blazing the trail. It was like a breath of fresh air. Mom's performed in all of the great places. She was the first. This is good, clean, dirty fun."
107406," You still determine to push ahead? Of course. This time we take the engine. Passengers, as in the beginning, I belong to the front. You belong to the tail. I'm in your place. Security expert, he's in the prison section now. We can get him to cooperate, he can take us all the way to the front to train. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Are you Nam-Goon Min-Soo? Security specialist?"

What are you listening to? Something cool. Oh yeah. Just makes me want to be in a dance club. Only guys though. No girls. What is this? Oh my God. This is so huge. Hi Sexy. Who is this? Guess. Mommy? Is that you? Does your daughter know you did gay porn? I love this song. It sounds awesome and amazing. This could be a big hit. I love your style. You're missing an important detail. What's that? Talent. Oh! Can you feel the beat? He takes off all of his clothes down to his underwear. Can you feel it? In your organs. Africa! That's my money. Stop it! Do you drive a car here today, man? Yeah, why? Don't look at me. It's about the feeling. It's all about the feeling. Your parents know you're a street hooker? No, because I'm not a street hooker. The Constitution is wrong. This might not be making perfect sense, but it makes sense up in my brain. What was the music you were listening to? I liked it a lot. I liked it a lot."
107516," I thought you guys had no rules. I thought you lived life and took risks and fucked systems. Damn, Ross, you are a bizarre individual. I mean, just like dad, what was his life for? Other than to die. He accidentally overdosed on Percodin. He thought there were vitamins. Classic. Fuck the world, I will deny you. I will deny. Out of my eyes, terrorizing them. How long has it been since you've seen Trish? Do you hear yourself? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Trish. Do you hear yourself? She's got a problem. Maybe I'm overthinking this. When Ross's mom gets a call saying... Ross is drinking, he's really drinking. My son doesn't drink. Is there any more beer? What actually happened to my poor boy to make him become so melancholy on such a fine spring day? You know, I know what you're thinking. You think I'm all screwed up because of some girl, but it is so much bigger than that. Oh my god. How do you know my son? I met him three years ago down on state. I was hanging out with some, not crusties, but... Skate punks? Not skate punks. Gutter punks? Gutter punks. I had this cousin who was a full blown Mormon. I'm going to stop being aloof. Let's give that man a ride. And they found him in a hotel room. Really hungry. You don't mind, do you? It was just mushrooms. With hookers. You don't buy that kind at the grocery market, man. And your perspective is your perspective. And like, if you had my perspective... Meth hookers. People should sell this stuff. You make a fortune. Shit, man. I'm worried. I can't imagine Ross at a punk concert. Just try and stay calm. Asshole! What? I'll come by and pick you up and we'll go look for him, okay? That guy is knocking the soul out of me. It's fine. I'm like his uncle. Fucking uncle, man. Me too. I need you to step back now. Run! Oh, shit! Bleeding heart, lefty drug addict. You mace me? Who maces people? I will run you through with my blade. What did I tell you? Why am I hearing about this for the first time? Ross fell in love. I heard about this girl too. What? I'm a terrible mother. Ross, what is going on with you? I need you to see me. This is who I am. Ross had to fill Bob's shoes his entire life. I'm just not interested. I mean you're not. A punk, right? You and me. Today was off the hook, man. You think it's a good idea to threaten your customers with, you know, actual death? Why do you think they come in here? At the end of the day, I'm still dead. So fuck you."
107559," The only thing that's interesting about him is his drawing. He spends hours in his room. Get out! Out! So what are you into besides drawing? Are they the kind of girls you like? No, but they're just stupid doodles, that's all. You seem like you're in your head a lot. He will not talk. Not to us, not to anyone. He's very angry. Of course he's angry. You being angry. We're just afraid he's gonna harm himself. Sometimes I can help people if they're afraid of dying. I'm not afraid. Oh, excellent. What were you feeling? I felt like I had control over something. For once. Did you two go around asking girls if they'd have sex with me? No. That's gone cost enough. No. Yes. I swear the day I turn 18 I'm out of here. Why would you do? I'm a very good paddock. Yeah. Sophie likes to come here all the time. This is where we first kissed. I've never been out with a girl before. Do you have a license? Nope. Any more questions? What are you supposed to do? You can't do anything. You've just gotta close your eyes and give yourself into it. Are you alright? I'm grand. I'd really like to see you get angry. You want to show me? Kind of."
107649," Je moet het mandokaat ergens op nemen. Je moet het in je corpus nemen. Goedemiddag. Zal ik hier misschien even een bad nemen? Waarom? Ik ben hier. Beloof je dat je je niet laat zien?

107771," 1868, our third wedding. You look so young. Give my regards to that suicidally romantic scoundrel. Let's hope he's just romantic. You being so reclusive in everything is probably only going to make people more interested in your music. Yeah. What a drag. My sister's looking for us. Shouldn't she be sleeping in a coffin somewhere? I'm really, really hungry. Could you smell it all the way from LA? We're going to have so much fun together. We got to go right now. Coming.

You've been pretty lucky in love, though, if I may say so. I have what you need. Not what I need."
107910," Coming this fall, it's called I Know That Voice. Hokey Smoke, I know that voice. Hi, my name is John DiMaggio. My name is Billy West. My name is Tara Strong. Eric Bowsen. I am Kevin Conroy. My real name is Tom Kenny. June Ferre. I'm Jess Harnell. I'm Carlos Alasraki. My name is David Kay. I'm Charlie Hedford. I'm Rachel McFarland. I'm Nika Futterman. My name is Andrea Romano. I approach voiceover as music almost. Most voiceover people love music. You're musically inclined to have an instinctive understanding of the music of speech. Because every character has a rhythm. If you think of a Yogi Bear, it was like music. It was like la la la la la la. Mel Blanc of course is the name you have to kind of throw out first because he lit the way for just about everybody else. He can do so many different kinds of voices. This looks like a job for Super Rabbit. Voice actors weren't even getting credit in cartoons. Say you're Plum Wright. June Ferre talk about I Know That Voice. When you trace her back, she was on like back in the 40s. She was a hero. These people were all heroes of mine. She's 90 plus years old now and still working and still working. You can teach them techniques of getting closer or whispering, but it comes from the heart. The big thing about the progression in voiceovers is video games. Video game you have to do so much more recordings, the volume of it. Really dominating entertainment in general. It just makes so much money. Any prompt, any kind of a thing that comes up in a video game, you have that response. Is he okay? And now video games has really come to I think a level of doing film. A lot of people think that voiceover is about doing funny voices. It's totally not. Voiceover is about creating characters. If they really are doing it right, they've gone through that emotional process that got them to that point and they're feeling whatever that character had to feel. For the most part, people wouldn't guess that Bubbles is the same as Terrence from Foster's Home. I'm not a chubby crybaby. Oh, that's even better. All the way in Malaysia. Because one is like, I'm very high-pitched, I like this, and the other is a nude. I like to look at what the character is about, how it's drawn, what the face looks like. Who the character is. What city they're in, what time it is, maybe it's a different planet. I don't necessarily go into a role-thinking cartoon. I think, how would this being sound? You know, if they want some kind of monster voice, they can be like, okay, that's good right there, you gotta keep that, you know, couple of teeth. Well, he's gotta be impaired somehow. You make him a little more dumber, too. So you can kind of slow him down. And I put two together, and you start...fuse them or supercollided them. It's not really a kid voice, like a Charlie Brown realistic kid voice. First I thought Mojo was a nice monkey, then I kicked it in his face! But it's not really an adult either. Vivo gorditas, I think I'm in love. Tigger, would you please stop that, Tigger, it's very annoying. Marvin the Martian from the Looney Tunes show, isn't that lovely? Young lady, bring me a sandwich from the dumpster. Yeah, yeah, I'll bring it. Yeah, baby. And leave the nuggets on it. Coming soon in a theater near you. Do you really think that it's best to keep the veil of privacy? Oh, yes, wait, hold on, yes, go ahead, ask me the next question. Don't be shocked by the tone of our voice. Check out my new weapon, weapon choice."

We will be watching to see who you really are. You made a mistake choosing Dauntless. They'll find out about you. I know what you are. You're afraid of heights. Everyone's afraid of something. But not you. Fear doesn't shut you down and wakes you up. That's what makes you dangerous. Divergence threaten the system. It won't be safe until they're removed. She's gonna kill me. We have to be ready for anything. The world is changing. You have to decide who you're loyal to. All of my life I've lived by your rules. Not anymore."

There are fingerprints of several children all over the house and Niamh's are amongst them. What do you think Niamh has done? You think she murdered an entire family? Are you alright? Yes. This is impossible. Have you seen what she's done? You talk to the children about what they said at school? They don't realize everything we did. They'll have to be punished. Are you giving me a goodnight kiss?"

Doesn't seem like a job, right? The first rule is this, when there's surf, we surf. And when it's flat, we work. Whether they're the start of something cool or the beginning of the end. Calm down mate. Calm down! Hang on, someone's definitely going to miss this. Grow up, Jim! That belongs to some very heavy people. I'm going to keep an eye on you, like, got it?

May I tell you something? Sure. You're my first. Really? I love you. I was starting to have trouble remembering who was who. I've thought about you often. Have you thought of me? Wow. Would it be alright if I show the children the whoring bed? You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Aaaaaaah! Wow. It was rebellious. What did you rebel against? Love. I've never met a bad human being. Well, you have now. You think you know everything about sex? I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything.

108729," See, every dictatorship, there's always one obsession and that's control. They want to have control over the people. In ancient Rome, they gave bread and circuses. They kept the populace busy with entertainment. In other dictatorships, they have other strategies to limit information, to limit ideas and knowledge. How do they do that? They lower education, limit culture. They censor any means of self-expression. It's important to remember this. This is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history."

Who said I love you first? She did. Women approach that phrase with a tactical strategy normally reserved for an anti-terrorist strike team. This was no accident. That was ambush.

Oh, what does our relationship mean to you then? Wait, you guys are in a relationship? I've been trying to pretend that things haven't changed. Hey, come here, man. Do not hug me with no pencil. You're right, respect. Being there for someone when they need you, that's all relationships are. I love the way she laughs. I love the way we fit together in bed because at the same height our crotches line up perfectly. That's really good. I love that. I love that. Yeah, man. So run and tell her that. All right, I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Man, you're doing it. Dude. Which one of you idiots uses Sub Ten? I do. Why? Because I thought it was lotion. What? And now my junk is orange. Oh no.

109487," We used to look up in the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now you just look down and worry about our place in the dirt. Go for main engine start, T minus 10. We must confront the reality that nothing in our solar system can help us. Nine. I've got kids, Professor. How long? Whenever you're gone. Eight. I'm asking you to trust me. Seven. Murph. You have to talk to me, Murph. Six. I need to fix this before I go. You have no idea when you're coming back. Five. Main engine start. Can you have told her you were going to save the world? No. Four. When you become a parent. Three. One thing that comes really clear. Two. The thing is that you want to make sure your children feel safe. One. I'm coming back. When? I love you forever. Potentially habitable worlds right within our reach. You could save us from extinction. Here we go. You can't just think about your family now. You have to think bigger than that. I am thinking about my family and millions of other families. Maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory. Love is the one thing that transcends time and space. Do not go gentle into that good night. Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Am I ready to make it? Yes, you are. We'll find a way that we always have."
109578," I hate flying. The lines, the crowds, the delays. I always kind of liked it. Six hours, one seat, nobody can get to you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard our non-stop service from New York to London. I don't fly much. All the time, actually. Someone on this flight is threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes unless 150 million dollars is transferred to this account number. We're midway across the Atlantic. How do you kill someone in a crowded plane and get away with it? Ladies and gentlemen, we need every passenger to raise their hands above their head. This is a bad idea. Marshal, we have a right to know what the hell is going on. Agent Marks, the account number you gave us is in your name. What? That doesn't make any sense. This is a setup. Something else is going on. The FBI, the White House, and Interpol are confirming reports that an international flight has been hijacked by an air marshal. Agent Marks, our fighter escort has you in their sights. Do you hear me? We're running out of time. Do you hear me? I'm the answer. Hijacking this plane. I'm trying to save it."
109673," The Oracle's words stand as a warning. Sparta will fall. All of Greece will fall. And only stout wooden ships can save them. Wooden ships. And a tidal wave of heroes' blood. Only the gods can defeat the Greeks. You will be a god-king. For glory's sake. War! War! Today we will dance across the backs of dead Greeks. She has sold her soul to death himself. She's going to bring all of hell with her. Leonidas and the Brave 300 are dead. Have I not given enough for your dream of a united Greece, the Mysticles? A king. A husband. Avenge him. I will attack the Greeks with my entire navy. Let it be shown, we chose to die on our feet. Rather than live on our knees. If death comes for me today, I'm ready. Stay to your heart. Look deep into your souls. Save your glory! A wind has blown across Greece. A wind of vengeance."
109687," Thank you all, thank you for your attention, thanks to everybody on the panel. If I could just ask you all to remain seated just for a few minutes. In exploration, there needs to be the set of people who have no rules, and they are going into the frontier. I've never heard of a moment in history where an entire field is hinging on a single event. The Large Hadron Collider, the biggest machine ever built, is finally going to turn on. You take two things and you smash them together. You get a lot of stuff out of that collision and you try to understand that stuff. Could be nothing other than just understanding everything. Little did I know when I started that the experiments would take 30 years, and here I am still not knowing. I really want to know the truth. The first time I ever saw it, I can remember walking in and just being stunned, like... Pipe stories completely filled with custom designed, hand-soldered microelectronics. There are 10,000 people, over 100 nationalities. 100,000 computers deal with the data. In fact, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN so that physicists could share the data. This is really my generation's only shot. Let's get started everybody. Now comes the day of reckoning. Given the complexity, they're already about a week or two behind. We're saying that all their tombs are breaking. It takes the question of what are the risks. It would be a catastrophe for physics. This helium leak, really frustrating. You've got magnets sheared off their jacks. Completely catastrophic. We're at a fork in the road and it's cranking up the suspense as much as it possibly can. We may discover additional space dimensions, the mystery and the origin of the universe. We may be at the end of the road. The entire control room is like a group of six-year-olds whose birthday is next week. It's incredible that it's happened in my lifetime. Whatever we learn is going to have a dramatic impact on the way human beings think about the universe forever."

I remember seeing a condom. I just don't know like exactly what it did. Maybe you want to tell him. Why? You don't owe him anything. You don't even know this guy. Maybe just so he knows that I'm not a psycho. This happened and I'm going to get an abortion. What's the matter sweetie? Mom can I come in bed with you? Talk to me. Hey Max, remember from before when we did sex with each other? I can't get your butt off. I'm having your abortion. Do you want to share a dessert? Lead with that. Definitely lead with that. Prove it. What is so great about you is that you are unapologetically yourself on that stage and that's why people love you. He's like so Christian. He's like a Christmas tree. So be the angel on top. I'm not the angel on top. I'm the menorah on top of the tree that burns it down. Max, I have something I want to tell you. There you go.

I joined SHIELD to protect people. Captain, to build a better world sometimes means tearing the old one down. And that makes enemies. Are you ready for the world to see you as you really are? Look out the window. You know how the game works. Disorder, war. All it takes is one step. We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.

110194," Our guests today in the studio are The National. We're about to talk to a band called The National. This is one of the most talked about bands on the planet. The new record is blowing up. Number three on the charts. You were recently the subject of a ten page spread in the New York Times. The Times piece mentions you guys are a band of brothers. But then there's you Matt. You're the guy in the band who doesn't have a brother. I do have a brother. He's more of a metalhead. He thinks indie rock's pretentious bullshit. Two weeks ago Matt called. He asked if I wanted to go on tour and be a roadie. I'm taking a camera on to make a documentary on the band. I had no idea it had never been a year. Welcome to Paris. So how famous do you think you are? That's... okay I... How fast can you play? What kind of drugs and how many drugs have you done? You carry wallets on a stage with you. Your ID while you're playing. Actually I do, yeah. That's just weird to me. It doesn't leave a lot to the imagination. But we can always blow it out. Don't worry about that. I just want to have fun on tour. I mean I'm with a rock band. You just need to be careful about not partying. You're not a band member, you're a crew member. I feel like the only reason why he thinks I'm on tour is because I'm your brother. The only reason you are here is because you're my brother. I feel like I'm on the outside of the world looking in. I don't even know what I'm doing here. I think Matt has gone from working a job to being a rock star. So it's like there's a shift there. If you have any kind of organization and plan for this film... You need to complete something. You always wanted to quit this. Do you think I'll be a movie maker? No! Do you think I will be dating a hot movie star someday? No way! I just want to make something good for him as well as myself. Where were you? Who were you with? I was with Brian and Scott!

Sonny, every year someone comes out of this looking like a donkey. Can you hear me? Yeah. Good, because tomorrow I got a feeling it could be you if you don't make this deal. Let's talk about the draft. I need you to make a splash, Sonny. If you can't do it, then I have to do it. Just to be clear here, you're threatening to fire me, Ryan. Your job is to coach a team I give you. They do it different in Dallas? Yeah, they do. They win. A lot. How is it that the ultimate prize in the most macho sport ever invented is a piece of jewelry?

That's one of the things I love about you. All that matters is what you seek. Write your own stories, Sonny. I want this team's future back. Let's get busy. Draft day. History in the making. 224 young men are about to become players in the National Football League. Bo Callahan, he's the surefire slam dunk number one pick. Trade me. I'm going to do what's best for the team. This is the draft analysis we've all been working on for the last two months. Just made a trade with the Seahawks. Sonny, that's our future. You sold a cow for magic beans. How does the entire world already know about this, Mom? Because I just tweeted it. You're on Twitter? You're not. I love having the number one pick. I hope that you would. The Cleveland Browns are now on the clock. It's go time, boss. You can go on row. What's happening? Who are you picking? You son of a- I need five minutes and then you can fire me. I got Tom Michaels on the line. Sonny, are we trading, sick? I quit, Sonny. Don't quit. See what I do from here. You're going to like this. The football world is in shock. Wondering what exactly the Cleveland Browns' Sonny Weaver Jr. is cooking up here. You're not going to believe what's happening.

110586," What do you want to say to me? I'm here to listen to whatever you have to say. I'm going to kill you, Father. Certainly a startling opening line. Do you think it was an idle threat? I don't know. I'm not sure. If you're not sure, it means it's possible. The body of Christ. Things you hear in Confessions these days. Do you know what felching is? I do know what felching is, yeah. I hate to look it up. That's what I've always liked about you, Father. You're just a little too sharp for this parish. Interesting man, you father. A good man, a fine man. Nobody around here has a bad word to say about him. Makes you wonder what he's hiding. I'm going to kill you because you're innocent. I gave you enough time to put your house in order. It's on the week, let's say. I have a word. I'm private. I hope we don't get locked in here. We'll have to make love to keep warm. Finish with all your gobbledygook. Every life is sacred, Frank, for God's sake. Some are less sacred than others. The commandment thou shalt not kill does not have an asterisk referring you to the list of instances where it's okay to kill people. What about self-defense? It's a tricky one, all right. What does this man want? There's no point in killing a bad priest. But killing a good one? That'd be a shock. I call the fire brigade, Father. Okay, Father. It takes a loving nerve to burn down a church. I'd say it was the Romanians. They're awful heathens. The Romanians. Nobody wear a grudge against your father, no? That could be half the country. The time is gone, you don't even realize it. My time will never be gone. I think there's too much talk about sins and not enough talk about virtues. I'll be your number one. I think forgiveness has been highly underrated. Do you not have anything to say to me, Father? Not right now, no. But I'm sure I'll think of something by Sunday week."
110611," When I read the book, I started reading on the subway and I got home and I said, I'll make dinner, I'll eat dinner, maybe I'll read a couple more chapters. And I walked in the door and I put the book down. I just read and finished it that night. And it goes through so many different sort of moments and aspects in the story and twists on itself so many times, yet it's totally fulfilling and satisfying in that way that I was just like, this is what entertainment to me doesn't do now. I just finished my first film and I was starting to read new scripts and kind of see what was out there. And everything is so one note, define what it is in the first five minutes, make sure that your audience knows exactly what your story is. There's a predictability and there's just a sense of like a lack of ambition, I think. I hope people come away from this movie with a sense of like, wow, I just saw something that feels familiar at times, but also in a combination and sort of a sense of tone that I'm not used to, it feels fresh and new. Hi, my name is Jim Mickle. I'm the director of Cold in July. It's playing in U.S. Dramatic Competition this year at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. Cold in July tells the story of a guy in the late 80s living in East Texas who wakes up one night to find a burglar in his living room. He kills the guy in self-defense and then finds out that the father of the guy that he just killed has just gotten out of prison and is coming to town. About halfway through it becomes a broader, bigger story than that, but I'll leave it at that. Michael Seahal plays Richard Dane, a small town guy who's sort of dealing with violence in his life for the first time and also dealing with this idea of men needing to test themselves in a way, which is one of the big themes of the book, and I thought Michael does a really incredible job at it. He brought sort of a vulnerability to it that I was hoping for and even surprised by how nimble he was at being able to bring that, but also a sense of humor. He brings a humanity to it that I think brings this very subtle humor to the whole thing. We were in Sundance 2013 with We Are What We Are, the last film, and I think it was Sundance that gave it that initial stamp seal of approval that allowed us to sort of go in all these places I never thought I'd go as a filmmaker. It was also, you know, I met Michael Seahal at a party at Sundance last year. So many things came out of that that to me it's a really great experience to be able to go back there with this film."

111113," Hey. Hi. It's a fabulous neighborhood. Look, new neighbors. Oh. What do we got? Is that a fraternity? We have to go over there. And we say, by the way, keep it down. Well, we weren't set like that. I'll throw it away. Keep it down. Don't do it like that. What? You're doing it a little weird. You can just keep it down. Just say it normal. Hey, homies.

111228," I lied and I lied and I lied. I lied about where I had been. I lied about where I had found information. And these were no normal lies. They were lies with details. I had never driven south down US-77 in the blazing heat. Never crossed the railroad tracks near the Anguiano household. I had never left my apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn. I can still remember the sweat, the kind of panic. Once you cross that barrier where you know the chances are you won't be caught, it becomes very hard to discipline yourself. The Jason Blair debacle became shorthand for all the shortcomings of the news business. Because it happened at the New York Times, because there were so many stories involved, this became an explosion.

Was the paper too eager to promote an appealing young black voice? It became about race because a black person was involved. A black person cannot be involved in anything without it being about race. All the stuff that gets fused in and becomes like this snowball that just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. He had better tips than the entire Washington Post because he was making it up. We were dealing with a disturbed individual who was exhibiting sociopathic behavior. I poured everything into journalism and I would lose it all and I was losing it all."

Me daban todos los medios económicos de hacer lo que yo quisiera y entonces lo que yo quise es crear un profeta. I want to create a prophet to change the young mind of all the world. For me Dune will be the coming of a god, artistical cinematographic god. For me it was not to make a picture, it was something deeper. I wanted to make something sacred, free, with new perspective, open the mind because I feel in that time myself inside a prison, my ego, my intellect. I want to open. I start the fight to make Dune."
111360," What happened? What did you do to my stomach? What's going on? We've nearly slipped a new package into your lower tummy. And you're going to transport something very special to us. No! Hey! You speak English? No, no, no. You speak English? Yes, yes. Take me to the hospital now. The hospital? Somebody put a bag of drugs inside me. I need you to take it out. It's leaking. It is estimated most human beings only use 10% of their brain's capacity. Imagine if we could access 100%. Interesting things begin to happen. Yes? Professor Norman, my name's Lucy. I just read all your research on the human brain. It's a little rudimentary, but you're on the right track. Thank you. I have access to 28% of my cerebral capacity. I can feel every living thing. Since when did you start writing Chinese? Since an hour ago. What happens when she reaches 100%? I have no idea. All this knowledge, you can unlock secrets that go beyond our universe.

You're pretty strong for Scrawny, kid. I said you need to leave. You and I are gonna be good friends. You just don't know it yet. We're gonna need Bastique. Why? You're cold-hearted, bitch. Well, don't hold back. Where's Magneto? That man is a monster. He's being held a hundred floors beneath the most heavily guarded building on the planet. I know a guy. He'd be a young man now. He's fascinating. He's a pain in the ass. Prison break? That's illegal, you know. Only if you get caught. Charles. Good to see you too, old friend. This is gonna be fun. There is a new enemy out there. You'll need a new weapon for this war. Everything that happens now is in your hands. In the future. Do I make it? No. Are we destined to destroy each other? Or can we change who we are and unite? Is the future truly set?"
111364," They're not fooling anybody that what happened was a natural disaster. It was not an earthquake. It wasn't a typhoon. They're lying. I'm not crazy. Whatever it is they're guarding so carefully. I need to be able to prove that it's real. The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control. And not the other way around.

You gave me the right amount, right? Oh my god, Anna, he knows what this is. Looking at the Old West through a contemporary lens makes it fun. You really do have a death wish, don't you? Oh wait, wait, wait, look at this. Look at our shadows. We barely know each other, but hey, when it's right, it's right, huh? I'll give you a little tap on the hat when I'm good to go, okay?

112138," A relationship is something that requires constant work. Doc, I just feel like sometimes he's not even trying anymore. Seriously, he's clingy, he's terrified of being by himself. Given all these strong feelings, why don't you hold hands? Um, he's literally reaching out for you. You won't hold my hand. You gotta interlock it though.

112303," I'm in Las Vegas from the casinos to the clubs, the pools and strip bars. It's the best place in the world for men and women to get their freak on. Zeke the Freak! This man is a legend with the ladies. I can only imagine. Oh baby you ain't got to imagine, we got this on video. Zeke the Freak is back in town! I don't know that dude. And it's still the number one destination for couples to do the craziest thing of all, get married. Mom! Are you in the adjoining suite? Once the door closes, you can barely hear a thing. Fortunately, I arrived the only way a sane person should. I'm talking about solo people. Hey, that Lambo okay right there right? It's my car. This is your bachelor party. Next 24 hours the boys will be with the boys. And the girls with the girls. In this battle of the sexes, I was determined to keep us ahead of the girls. You're rolling with the pros. Let's go!

Let's show them how it's done. Oh boy. You stole the boys ride? Genius. Now where are they going to get around? We're at one of the pent out party bus with the stripper pulling. Do we look like a group of guys that's going to roll to a spot or something like this? As a matter of fact you do. This is Vegas! No! Get down! Farfide! Are we in here right now? Let me do all the talking. No, no, no. This is on the season one holder of eyes. Have you seen it? No. Exactly, so you don't have the knowledge. Everybody listen up! It's too deep! I can't smoke! It's like finding Nemo with this dude. Should we help him? Spare me!"
112334," You know, it's easy sometimes to feel like you're powerless, like when you come out in the streets and you march and you yell and nobody hears you. But I'm here to tell you today, you are powerful. You can stop this bill. A co-founder of the social news and entertainment website Reddit has been found dead. Aaron learned how to learn at a very young age. Bob introduced him to computers and he just took off. He certainly was a prodigy, although he never kind of thought of himself like that. He really had different aspirations for the purposes of political goals. He was sort of learning to hack politics. Stop soap up! This bill poses a serious threat for all who use the internet. The freedoms our country had been built on would be suddenly deleted. But I couldn't let that happen. Aaron was trying to make the world work. He was trying to fix it. Bringing public access to the public domain. He doesn't hack JSTOR in the traditional sense of hacking. He wasn't stealing, he was making a point. They arrested him, strip searched him and left him in solitary confinement. He said they want to make an example out of me. On the internet, everybody has a license to speak. It's a question of who gets heard. Aaron Swartz was not a criminal. You can say, oh, this is another instance of cyber war. The cyber criminals are attacking us again. They use those as excuses to push through more and more dangerous laws. This is a poor use of prosecutorial discretion. It should have never gotten the attention of the criminal system. We need to galvanize opposition today because today is when it matters. I'm still angry. This is what we as a people think is okay. Aaron was willing to put himself at risk for the causes that he believed in. He was the internet's own boy and the old world killed him. Hello, Valerie here! Now just as quickly as David Fincher bought out of the Steve Jobs biopic, Sony are now in talks with Danny Boyle to direct. Rumors are also circling that the filmmaker has approached Leonardo DiCaprio to star as the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. As yet nothing has been confirmed for neither Boyle or DiCaprio, who last worked together on the 2000 drama The Beach. That's all for today, subscribe to keep up to date and remember the pen is mightier than the sword. Bye bye!"
112399," The auction house is across the street from my home. I found this box loaded with negatives. I won it for, I think it was $380. The history of street photography is currently being rewritten. Vivian Meyer. Vivian Meyer. Vivian Meyer. Exhibitions in New York, in LA, in London, in Chicago. We've had more interest in this work than perhaps any other photographer. There's one particular that I bought, which I love. The composition is slightly off to me and I think that's why I like it. Vivian was a very private woman. She was so awesomely neat. She was not an open person, she was a closed person. Vivian was my nanny. Yeah, she was our nanny. We certainly had no idea that she took photographs. She lived on the third floor in our attic. This was the forbidden zone. One of the first things she asked me for was please to put in a lock. She said, don't ever open this door. They didn't know there was this creative person there. She took so many photos. Around 100,000 negatives, 700 rolls of undeveloped color film, 8mm and 16mm movies. She would take us and we would just walk in the worst parts of town. I think she liked that. You know, maybe we just didn't understand her. What would you say to Vivian now? What drove you to hide yourself away? I'd say to her, why the f***? Why the f*** didn't you ever show me all the stuff you did? I thought I was a friend of yours. In death, she is getting the fame that she never had in life. I'm uncovering an artist. If I'm leaving this giant boulder unturned, it would be a mistake. Of course, she would have hated every minute of it. She would never have let this happen. She had some compulsive behaviors. She was a pack rat. I asked her what she did. Her answer was, I'm sort of a spy. We would say, what's your name? Miss V. Smith. There's a piece of the puzzle missing. As she was photographing, she was seeing just how close you can come into somebody's space. That tells me a lot about her. She could get them to accommodate her by being themselves. She could generate this moment, and then she's gone. Is there anything that you wish was done differently then? Sure, I wish I would have found those negatives instead of you."
112421," I say tell everyone everything. I might cover anything up, right? How to describe Frank? One, two, three, four! Well, there's the head, of course. He never takes it off. You think it's weird? Would it help if I said my facial expression's out loud? Welcoming smile. Delighted look. But what goes on inside the head inside that head? I find this inspiring. Is music. Something is pressing something against! Frank, people should know about you. You should be famous. Flattered grin, followed by bashful half-smile. Stop saying your facial expression's out loud. It's extremely annoying. We've been offered a really important gig. South by Southwest, in Texas. People are interested in us. We could be big. What game are you playing? Filling Frank's head with these bullshit ideas. I can't hear you over the sound of the bubbles. Someone needs to punch you in the face. Here we go. It's gonna be huge. You gotta come see us tomorrow night. I promise with the van life. We're back for real! Frank's not okay. Frank, come back! With all his issues, the 100% sanest cat I've ever met. Oh, what the hell? Okay. The head. The head. Take it off. I have a certificate. Take it off! Here it is. My most likable song ever. Coca-Cola, lipstick, Ringo, dance all night, dance all night. Kiss me, just kiss me, kiss me nefertiti. This is your most likable song ever? Yeah. People will love it. Hey!"
112450," What have you been editing? This movie that we shot in July called They Came Together with Paul Rudd who's in this movie and Amy Poehler. It's a really stupid romantic comedy. It's kind of a spoof right? Kind of. A lot of people are always curious about A Second One Hot American Summer. Is there progress on that? Working on it. In progress. Alright great. We've been asking people since kids go back to school this coming week, do you have any awkward first day of school stories? I once went the first day of school wearing a rugby shirt because I thought it would be really cool. This was in the 80s. No, I can't think of anything. I thought something would come out. That wasn't awkward or anything. It was so awkward. Oh my god, it's so funny. Thank you, I appreciate it. That's one. Wait, let me think of one. It doesn't have to be first day. One day when I was in school I got there and I thought that the girl that I really liked who I had missed all summer would finally go out with me because I had finally gotten a nose job. And then she said I was still ugly. Ouch. I know. You asked for a refund? Well now I'm famous. So fuck her."
112460," All right, Mott droppers, fire broke containment, split in two. Wind lifter copy. All aircraft, we've got a report of a wildfire. Dangerous work! But that's the job of a firefighter. There she burns fellas! Risk in their lives for people they don't even know. Who came here to become a firefighter? Good luck Dusty! I will never understand why you want to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. We're not! We're jumping out of you! I'm Dipper, that's what everyone calls me. Okay, Mrs. Miss. Miss. Yeah. Dipper. Dipper. Yep. Hong Hong beep beep. Park Superintendent. He waxes himself daily. I can do this. You're not certified. Just give him a shot. He's not certified. We need every plane we've got.

112497," The robber was five foot two, white female. As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left. Cause I've been blasted and laughing so long that even my mama thinks that my mind is gone. Freeze! Nobody move! Shoot! She was super bossy. Give me some pies! Give me some of the good pies! No screwing around! That's your finger though. Is it? You knocked over a topper, Jax. Do you want some pies? You want pies? Yes, please. I feel like we're kind of getting somewhere and under different circumstances we'd probably be, you know, good pals, like find like a hot tub or... I actually have one in my apartment complex. Fingers crossed. We meet up again. Grandma. I don't know where I'm going. I've always wanted to go to Niagara Falls. How about a beer? No. Whiskey? No! Oh my god. You're pregnant! I'm driving a car! You're a fugitive from justice. Look out, fish! I'm scared! You think I'm a woman? Maybe you're a woman. You know what I mean? I'm scared of you. I'm scared of you. Don't you think I'm a woman? I'm not a woman. I'm a woman. I'm scared of you. I'm scared of you. I'm scared of you. I'm scared of you. I'm scared of you. I'm scared of you. Look at that fish! I'm scared of you. You're gonna have to come with us. Let's go. Oh, come on. Man. Let's go. Ma'am! Get! Are you serious? There was a bee! There's no bees here, ma'am. There was a bee! Here, just throw the money through the window and we'll get out of here. I'm un-robbing you! I'm giving it back! Oh my God, there's two of them. We're gonna need more pies! America, huh? What have you ever done that's that cool? I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. On his bike? Neil."
112552," This place is nice. I really like the music that they play. Bob Ellis on the drums. I'm part of Schaeffer's top jazz orchestra. It's the best music school in the country. The key is to just relax. Don't worry about the numbers. Don't worry about what the other guys are thinking. You're here for a reason. Have fun. Five, six, and. I want to be great. And I want to be great. I want to be great. And you're not. We got Buddy Rich here. Little trouble there. You're rushing. Here we go. Five, six, and. Were you rushing or were you dragging?

I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. You are a worthless pansy ass who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drum set like a nine-year-old girl. So how's it going with the studio man? Good. Yeah, I think he likes me more now. I push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that is an absolute necessity. I want to be one of the greats. And because I'm doing that, it's going to take up more of my time. And this is why I don't think that we should be together. I would never let him put my son through hell. Why would you let him get away with what he did to you? There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig. I'm a pig.

112556," As you all know, my wife, Amy Elliot Dunn, disappeared three days ago. She may be the face I can't forget, a trace of pleasure or regret. May be my treasure or the price I have to pay. She may be the song that summer sings, may be the chill that autumn brings. May be a hundred different things within the measure of a day. She may be the reason I survive, the why and wherefore I'm alive. The one I'll care for through the rough and rainy years. Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears and make them all my souvenirs. Where she goes, I've got to be. The meaning of my life is... She... She... Stay back everybody, stay back. I did not kill my wife. I am not a murderer."
112582," Hi, I'm Lucas Shaw. Welcome to the rap studio at Sundance. I am here with Chaz Ebert and Steve James to talk about a documentary called Life Itself about famed film critic Roger Ebert. Premiers tomorrow and we, I believe, are the first interviews that you guys are doing in Park City, so welcome. Thank you. Good to be here. Steve, I've spoken with you before just because there's a crowdfunding campaign for the Finishing of this movie. Chaz, I haven't had the pleasure of talking to you about it before. How did this documentary come together so quickly after Roger died? I think that's a question that Steve should answer. I do have one thing to say. I think that we were very fortunate to at least start it when we did because, of course, we didn't have a crystal ball and when we started the project we had no idea that Roger was going to pass away so soon. Right. Yeah, and in fact Chaz really, she saw that early on and was really pushing to get it underway. And it's amazing to me that the film took basically a little more than a year to make. It's hard to believe we did it all in a little more than a year. And I don't feel like it's a film that we rushed to make at all. I feel really good about the time that we spent making it and getting to know Chaz and Roger in a way that, you know, I only knew them very casually before. And so it was a very inspired sort of process. Why was, I mean, did you approach Steve, did he approach you? No, actually Stephen Zalien who did Schindler's List and Moneyball read the book. He read my husband's memoir, Life Itself, and he had the good vision to see that it might make a good film. And so he contacted Steve James. And then I think they mentioned my name to you guys and fortunately they gave me the thumbs up, not the thumbs down. You know, 20 years ago here at this very festival, Roger discovered a movie called Hoop Dreams. Which is screening on Monday. It's screening on Monday here and it's the 20th year anniversary. And I remember I sat there with Roger and Gene Siskel when they were watching Hoop Dreams and we were all in awe of this movie. I mean, at the time there had been nothing like it. And I remember how excited they were about Hoop Dreams. Yeah, they reviewed it while we were at Sundance where the only place you could actually see it was here. Right. And so coming full circle for Steve to be bringing Life Itself to Sundance at the same time that he's celebrating the 20th anniversary of Hoop Dreams is just, it's really, really poignant. Right. You said it. Have you seen the finished product of this movie? I have not seen the finished product. I decided that I didn't want to. That might not be the wisest thing to do, but I decided, you know, it's a very Roger thing to do, to want to make a discovery of a film at Sundance. And so I said, I want to wait and see it with everybody else. The finished product. And so I get to do that tomorrow night. Are you at all nervous about it? I am. I have to admit, you know, they say never let them see you sweat. I have to tell you, I am a little nervous. I have butterflies in my stomach. I trust Steve as a filmmaker, but still, that's going to be my man on the screen. And I have butterflies in my stomach. Well, and I mean, there are any number of cases I can remember where you have someone before and it just overcomes them emotionally and you can see it afterwards where they're I've got butterflies too. So I mean, what is the subject beyond or how do you treat the subject of Roger? What is the story that it is telling and what is the arc that you're? Well, I really, I mean, it's based on the memoir and the memoir was a great inspiration and great resource, of course. And I really love the way Roger told his life story in the book because it's largely linear in the memoir, but it does go back and forth some between the past and the present. And so we do that as well in the film. Those last four months that we were able to spend with Roger, which has are kind of a spine for the film, but off of that, we springboard into the life story of Roger. And there are so many things about his life that are fascinating and interesting. I mean, I think he called the memoir life itself because even though he loved movies, life itself was a powerful and wonderful experience."
112623," ... ... Beggars... Do not! Want... War! ... You know the scary thing about them? They don't need power. Lights, heat, nothing. That's their advantage. That's what makes them stronger.

Who was that? A good man like you. Caesar loved humans more than apes. If you threaten his family, he will retaliate. Don't shoot! Don't you move! Should we shoot him? Maybe. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

112653," Long before steroids and multimillion-dollar contracts, there was a truly independent ball club. A bunch of guys who were hopeless dreamers looking for a second chance. In short, the best kind of people. When we first heard about Bing Russell, there was this buzz about, well, who's Bing Russell? And he was in the Magnificent Seven, and he was the sheriff from Bonanza. My dad got killed 126 times, I think it was. Why would Bing Russell come to Portland? Bing was out to prove that independent baseball could work. I think we charged Bing $500 for the franchise. So we started from scratch. We're gonna have open trials. Show us for the fools that we are coming from Hollywood. You'd expect maybe 40 or 50 people to show up, and I think 300 showed up. Guys who drove clear across the country and sacrificed this or sold this just for the chance to come and try it. I don't care about the money. I just want to play ball. There was no press handlers. There was no groomed image. There was just these furry, hairy, funny, great bunch of guys. The things that happened on the field were absolutely insane. Organized baseball didn't like Bing, and they did everything they could to make sure Bing didn't win. He couldn't stand them. They couldn't stand him. Portland is the greatest baseball city in the world. We broke attendance records in the entire minor leagues that year. We really emphasize fun. The fans loved it. I've never seen a ball team and fans behave the way they did with the Mavericks. He created the most successful team in the history of minor league baseball. This is going to be magic."

113705," When we started this rehearsal process that is very specific to the Darden Brothers work, we didn't really talk about the character right away. They knew that I was searching. This rehearsal process was more about finding the choreography of the camera and the actors, so it was not focused on acting. But it's part of the same because, of course, to find the energy of a scene, you have to find the energy of your character. But they knew that I was working on what was inside and that it would affect the rhythm of how they would shoot the scenes. But they never really asked me something specific at the beginning of the rehearsals. They let me start the process within myself. And then when they thought something was not exactly what they wanted, they would tell me. And actually, they were always right. The only thing that they asked me, and that was one of the first things they asked, was to lose my French accent, Parisian accent. I need to replace my French or Parisian accent by something which wouldn't be a Belgium accent. It's slightly different when they ask to lose something. Thank you."

113862," We're here at the RAP Video Studio at TOW at Village at the Lift here in Park City. I'm here with the team behind the midnight in Park City movie, The Guest. With me are from my left writer Simon Barrett, director Adam Wingard, and actors Lance Reddick, Dan Stevens, and Michael Monroe. Guys, thank you for joining us. So for the folks at home who have not seen the film yet, can you give us a little bit a taste of what it's about? The Guest is an action thriller about a family whose son passed away and about a year after that a stranger comes to their home, they meet up with friends with their son and they invite him to stay and he starts affecting their lives in increasingly violent ways. Now what was the sort of genesis behind the project? How'd you, where'd the idea come from guys? Well initially after doing Year Next, Simon and I really wanted to try our hand at action, doing an action film because that was kind of where we first bonded was over John Woo movie and stuff like that. So we kind of went down the road with this kind of crazy nonstop action film that we were going to do in South Korea and the project ended up just not coming together for a lot of reasons but mainly of which we just, the experiment of, well every film that we do we try to have a little bit of an experiment quality to it where we're like challenging ourselves and we're trying to do something different and with that film the experiment was going to be can we do a film that's a nonstop action chase scene basically and figure out a way to develop the characters as it goes and just make it just full on. But within doing that we kind of realized that at least we weren't able to crack the code on that. It was a really cool script, it's got great set pieces and stuff but we were just never able to really connect with it in the right way. So we kind of regrouped and one day I was just like sitting around and I had a stack of DVDs with me at the office and I ended up watching a double feature of the original Terminator and Halloween and there was just something about that, just like the mishmash of those films that just seemed like, it just seemed like a great starting point. So I brought it up with Simon, you know, because initially I wanted to do something also that involved more like kind of a sideboard kind of Terminator thing and whenever I first told Simon about it, you know, I told him the experience I had watching those two films back to back and that kind of spurred a conversation. Do you want to pick up from there? Well yeah, I mean the interesting thing is I'd already kind of taken a crack at this story several years prior before I actually started working with Adam and I was just kind of writing for an audience of no one and I started writing it as a drama, as a very serious film that was more about like commenting on like PTSD and our military actions overseas and I stopped at like page 35 because it was just very depressing and I felt like it was a film that no one would ever want to see and I abandoned it but there were things I loved about it, like the relationship between the characters and when Adam came to me with this I was kind of like, you know, actually I have an idea that might kind of organically fuse with this and we could do something kind of original that still has these kind of throwback elements and yeah, and I mean it was funny to come back to that script and realize that what had been missing was that sense of fun and humor and action and stuff and from that point it was, you know, from that point on we were pretty much straight ahead to making the movie. Now I want to talk about casting for a little bit because it's so vital to a movie like this. I feel like the actors really helped you guys achieve the tone that you're going for and your lead needs to be able to shift between light and dark. Now I've never seen Downton Abbey. Dan is obviously famous across the world but this is my first introduction to your work and you blew me away. So I don't know, can you guys sort of talk about casting Dan and then Dan, why did you decide to sort of make this your first big feature if I'm not mistaken? Yeah, well like in going into this I knew that the character that Simon had written was just a really fun character and it was one of those things where it treaded the line where if it wasn't done correctly, if it wasn't done by somebody who had kind of a very just natural charisma and a kind of cool calm kind of thing that he could do, it would just completely fall apart. And so Dan was actually one of the first people that I met with when I was doing my kind of rounds meeting with different actors and just immediately he just had that quality naturally. I feel like whenever you're casting you want to find somebody who not just that you can imagine in the role but they kind of already embody a good portion of what you're looking for just in their natural personality and it goes the same for the whole cast. I can play everybody else and so yeah it was just one of those things where as soon as I talked with Dan we had a little Skype conversation and then later on we had a little dinner but it was just immediately."
114028," The government today insisted it will close 20 pits with a loss of over 20,000 jobs. Without that pit, these villages are finished. Mining communities are being bullied just like we are. What they need is cash. Yeah, because the miners have always come to our aid, haven't they? It doesn't matter. It's the right thing to do. So we are going to pick a mining town completely at random. What else? Die! Your gays have arrived! Don't mind everybody. Name me the group you represent in this case. Lesbians and gays support the miners. I hope you can clear something up for me about lesbians. It did surprise me. Let them get settled in first, shall we? Huh. A gaggle of gays and lesbians has come out in favour of the miners strike. We've been backed up by perverts. We've been through some of the same things you've been through. Look, we raised this money because we want to help you. That's it. Everything will be all right once they start to mix. What the hell do you think you're doing? Get out there and find a gay or a lesbian right now. I don't want to give them the wrong impression. Right, because you're so bloody irresistible. Every day they're out collecting for us. What they're really doing is pushing their own agenda. You better shut her mouth or I'm going to do it. Get out! That's enough. It's you lot, is it? The gays? Yes, lesbians and gays support the miners. What's going on? Thank you. Yes. When you're in a battle against an enemy so much bigger, so much stronger than you, but to find out you had a friend you never knew existed, well, that's the best feeling in the world. I was told about lesbians can't be true, can they? You're all vegetarians. You see what we've done here? By pledging our friendship, we've made history. Sorry, this is a men-only. Oh, don't be damp. We want to see everything, even the rubber scene. Where are my lesbians? What's this? God, that takes me back. Don't those women ever sleep?"

I made a coffee. What's going on with you? You feel distant, different. Did something happen in the woods? What's this? They're mosquito bites. They don't look like bug bites. You're acting crazy. You should leave. You're not safe. What's going on? We need to leave. You can't. Where did you put the keys? Where are the keys? Who's out there? You're shining a light. I want to protect you. Where's my wife? You look like her, but you're not her. Talk to me! Tell me where you are! And will you tell me what's going on? Something bad happened to me.

And it's not the kind of money that you can deposit in a bank. You handle the drop. But all that money needs to end up somewhere. They call it a drop bar. You just hide the entire amount of money in the bank. All your money in the bag. Do you know what you're doing? Do you know whose money you're jacking? Throw the bag! You don't see anything, Clav. You know, that's this neighborhood, right? I heard that Cousin Mark doesn't know the bar. Some hard guys do. You're not a hard guy. Yeah, I'm a hard guy. I'm a hard guy. I'm a hard guy.

Marv, he thought he was a tough guy. Then the neighborhood changed. It wasn't enough to be tough anymore. You know, you had to be mean. Do you know this guy? No. Find my money. My money. You need to see this, Marv. No, I don't need to see what's in that bag. No, don't look at that. Don't look at that. You're still in the life. No. No, I just stand the bar. Give a little round of the front of the bar and take a look at the names on the sign. You know, that's my name. Because I used to own it once. Depressed, you blinked. It's over. It's been over for a while now. I'm not this. And I'm not them. Where is your cousin, Marv? Sit down. No. When I walked into a place people sat up straight, they noticed I was respected. I was feared. And that meant something. Are you doing something desperate? Are you doing something that we can't clean up this time? There's some sins that you commit that you can't come back from. You're not going to come back from that. You're not going to come back from that. You're not going to come back from that. You're not going to come back from that.

This was an accident period. We need to establish a firm defense. There's no we here, Henry. I wish I liked you more. I can't stay. You're a lawyer. He is your father. You leave now. You're a lawyer. He is your father. You leave now. You are a grand. You're a shined up wooden nickel, Mr. Palmer. I'm going to impale your client on the first degree murder charge and you get a front row seat. My father's a lot of unpleasant things. A murderer is not one of them. I have memories of us. Then I don't. Why? Was I tough on you? Yes. I did what I thought was right. My experience, Hank, sometimes you got to forgive in order to be forgiven. You and I are finally done. No, we're not done."
115174," I actually was here before there was Sundance. I came in 1979 when it was called the US Film Festival and I was 14 years old. So I've been coming here for a long time, 34 years. This is really where independent film has found a birth and where as a filmmaker you've found real support for a career. You know, you need that ongoing support and each time it's difficult in certain ways and this is also a market. So you're bringing your film to market. I guess what I'm most proud of in general is that you feel in the relationship between Alfred Molina and John Lithgow that there is real history and I think that's very hard to depict in a film which is you believe that 40 years. And that's really a testament I think to some extent to the script and hopefully to what I've brought to it but also to what Lithgow and Molina have brought together and really part of what they've brought is their own understanding of what their marriages look like. When this came out, it was just delightful. It was kind of a film absolutely right. And we had exactly the same reaction to the script. That it was this, you know, it's a script about a gay marriage but it's about a marriage. It's such an authentic 40-year-long relationship and you just don't see that. What's most rewarding is I think audiences see themselves in the story. I mean my mother who's been with my stepfather for 41 years, she keeps telling me how the film, she keeps thinking about the film because it reminds her of her life with her partner. And I think there's a way in which the film gives people access to certain things about their own intimate relationships that they might haven't thought of."
115210," If you think it can't get worse, it can, and it will. The dying's not done, the killing's not done. I promised my crew a long time ago I'd keep them alive. I was afraid you were dead.

I can't pay my bills. There is something. You have to hear me out. You thought of me for a teaching job. Teaching is an absurd profession practiced by desperate fakers. Keith? If it pays, I'll take it. I don't believe that anything worth knowing can be taught. I intend to do as little as possible while carrying on with this charade. Hello, Flo. Welcome to the screenwriting class. Rosa. Moa. You're a good looking guy, Dave. Get your own screenwriting class. I'm Holly Carpenter. What do you teach, Holly? I'm a sophomore. That's good. It's wonderful going back to school at your... Height? Yes, exactly. I thought that's what you meant. I just have a question. I would expect no less. If you don't believe writing can be taught, what are we going to be doing in class? So... The truth is that I'm going to be writing a movie about a teacher. Who's going to be in it? I'm not at liberty to discuss that, you know. Matt hasn't committed yet. Matt Demon. Oh my God. You arrived on campus, became inebriated, insulted members of the faculty. You don't like Jane Austen? I'm just a little bit nervous. You don't like Jane Austen? I'm just a little bit tired of female empowerment. You dismissed your class for a month. And that class bears a suspicious resemblance to a beauty pageant. Not the man. Well, I'm glad you've thought it through. You're trying to fill a spiritual vacancy with alcohol and young women? Yes. That's what you hoped for, isn't it? You find some smart, funny woman full of fire and honesty. I found myself missing you. It's quite possible that if I'd stayed away for more hours, I'd have just completely got over that. But now we'll never know. Stay out of trouble. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll do. And just one other thing. Tell him if Matt wants a meeting, he's going to have to come here. Matt? Who is Matt? Because, you know, there's always Ryan. Gosling or Reynolds?"

And I'm thinking, television news might just be something I love as well as something I happen to be good at. Now, I know that today's work culture no longer caters to the job loyalty that could be promised to earlier generations. What I believe is that good things come to those who work their asses off.

115680," Hey, Mr. Bezorides, are you home? These are shots of our living room. What is this thing? I think it's a camera. No way. Mr. B invented a camera that takes pictures of the future. The camera spits out a photo of us in the future. Then we go about our day making a series of decisions that lead up to the future. Think about how much money we can make. Come on! Run! Yes! This is just the start. Just smile and say goodbye to your day jobs, guys. Who is this? That's my bookie. What is he doing in the apartment?

You want to prosecute? That's up to you. But before you make any decision, I think you ought to know. One of the defendants is a kid named Apache. I used to go with his mother when I was a kid. Oh, boy, Hank, the papers would have a field day with this one. You are aware that under the laws of the United States, a man is presumed innocent till proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Those are three nice guys you're trying to frame. Those three nice guys committed murder. Lots of nice guys all through history kill people. In a war, the more people you kill, the more medals you get. Our readers are expecting the chair for the killers of this gentle and poetic blind boy. You're going to kill my kid? You're going to put his eyes out and come at him with knives in the darkness? You're going to kill him like an animal, huh? Supposing he did have a knife, you would have been using it and seen it. You would have been using it in self-defense. He had a knife. We'll never make murder one stick with the jury. Here, so many people, but is no one here say to you hello?

I have the desire and the training. All I lack is a clinical experience. Most patients are here because they are embarrassments to their families. There are few therapies better at restoring the soul than music. Don't you agree Doctor? Beautiful. Interesting case this one. His family sold him off to a sideshow when he was a child. Hello? Suicidal tendencies are not uncommon amongst the Durang. Did he stab himself in the back as well? You do not belong here. Tell me what's going on. Edward! How do you know my name?

Pick the restaurant, make the reservation. I wonder why those relationships didn't last. Last night I took you home in monochrome. Too mature for this now that you've spent the whole weekend roasting a chicken together? How do you know that? You posted on Instagram. Wake up, you've been replaced. Paige didn't ditch me.

It's kind of hard to stay in the moment when your partner keeps telling you that everything she's doing is her signature move. Sasha, my signature move. I told Tim that you went out with like three girls recently that live at home. You told Tim a lot about me. Guess I should have known that as soon as you found someone else to couple up with that you'd be done with me. Yes, I'm less available to you now than I was when there was no one else in my life. You still talk to someone at two in the morning. Nothing changed for you. It just changed for me. Can you acknowledge that, please? Do I look too much like a lesbian? You are a lesbian.

Welcome to Enigma. It's the greatest encryption device in history. The Germans use it for all major communications. 159 million, million, million possible settings. It's unbreakable. Let me try and we'll know for sure. To Turing, do you know how many have died because of Enigma? Three. While we've been having this conversation. Churchill's put Alan in charge. Keith in charge's both fired. Popular at school, are you? Am I short on staff? We get more staff. You have six minutes to complete the task. Is that even possible? It takes me eight. Five minutes and 34 seconds. You said to do it in under six. What is it that we're really doing? We're going to break an unbreakable Nazi code and win the war. Oh. To pull off this genius wu-ti, one actually has to be a genius. It doesn't matter how smart you are. Enigma is always smarter. What if only a machine can defeat another machine? Have you decrypted a single German message? My machine will work. Sooner or later, you will make a mistake. What if I don't fancy German in that way? It's illegal. They're looking for any excuse to put you away. You've got more secrets than the best. Am I a criminal? Am I a war hero? You don't get to decide who lives and who dies. No one else can.

He's a private investigator. Whoa! Are you alright? Am I? Are you? And like a peculiar planet in today's horoscope, in through the door walks Doc's ex-old lady Shasta and those five little words. I need your help, Doc. Let's go! It's too bad that fear should be running sunny Southern California as in days of old, like the Watts Riots or the Hollywood Blacklist. Look at the greedy little hippie. But every once in a while, a hero like Doc Sportello shows up to help salvage his generation and guide it back to more merciful shores.

Move in with Dylan, of course. Are you wearing perfume? The woman at Darkdorfs told me that it's unisex. And you wanted to smell sexually ambiguous?

117123," You're listening to Winchester University's only college radio station. Dear white people, the minimum requirement of black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two. Sorry, but your weed man, Tyrone, does not count. Dear white people, please stop touching my hair. Does this look like a petting zoo to you? Mr. Sin, dating a black person to piss off your parents is a form of racism. The show is racist. Black people can't be racist. Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. I don't see what the point is in blaming white folks for everything. I really don't see the issue. I never ran into any lynch mob. It would be good to elect someone like you as school president. Someone else is running. Together, we can bring black back to Winchester. Who does Sam think she is? This like Spike Lee and Oprah had some sort of pissed off baby. How do I feel about dear white people? It's blacker than thou propaganda from a boo shade Lisa Bonet wannabe. Black people scare you? I listen to Mumford and Sons and watch Robert Altman movies. Like I'm black enough for the union. Lionel, please. You're only technically black. Sometimes I think the hardest thing to be in the American workforce is an educated white guy. They pay millions of dollars on their lips, their tans, JZ tickets because they want to be like us. Let's make it do what it do. You want to know why they used to call me Black Mitch? Absolutely not. Nobody called you that. You've got no idea what they see when they see you. You've got a thing for Taylor Swift. I know because my Mac picks up your Mac's library. I was so careful. You don't understand. Girls like me. I'm sick of your tragic mulatto bull. I can't say mulatto. Mulatto, mulatto, mulatto. Did somebody say mulatto? How would you feel if someone started a Dear Black People? No need. Mass media from Fox News makes it clear what white people think of us. Your hair is so cute. Is it weaved? Weaved, it's weave. Noun, present tense. Racism is over in America. The only people who are thinking about it are Mexicans probably."

There won't be a situation where you get through a film and go, well, I assumed everything that happened. That is just not possible. It is relentless by its very nature, and you must meet that task with your own relentless energy. I'll give you a little example, no matter how much preparation you do. So I've got a steam train sequence in the movie. I've got to go and find a steam train. So we're looking around at steam trains. The prettiest one was in a South Australian town called Corn. On the Monday morning, about five o'clock, beginning of one of only two six-day weeks that we did, get the little piece of information that says, Oh, by the way, the temperature today is going to rise to 49.5 degrees Celsius, which is 121.6 Fahrenheit. In the outback, they're going to put a fire ban on when it hits about 40 degrees. So five o'clock in the morning, I'm shooting a steam train sequence in a place where fires are now banned, and a fucking steam train doesn't move unless it's got fire. The way I solved that was by bribing these guys at this place to bring out a diesel engine, and we shot all of our moving stuff being pulled by a diesel engine. And then later on in post, we went back, got a few shots of my beautiful steam train, and we stuck it together. But that's the thing, every day in that place, the bloke on the news would go, And today, corn is the hottest place on the planet."

118105," Hey my lead and how y'all doing today? I'm back with a couple movie reviews and the first one the main one is a brand new comedy special, concert film comedy special from Netflix, Trailer Park Boys Live from the North Pole. Alright? Now this is another concert film somewhat like the other one I reviewed, Trailer Park Live from fucking Dublin. But this one is different. They show them in the trailer park and stuff like that decorated Christmas tree and Julian's got this side business Christmas business selling Christmas ornaments and decorations for extra money and they had their bubbles are setting up this big tree and he wants to decorate it but unfortunately Julian sold all the Christmas ornaments and stuff like that and they wondered why they were getting all this stuff and Ricky said they were getting it from a wholesaler. Apparently Ricky was stealing it from other people's houses and he got like this Christmas award and this lady said this ain't your house. They said yeah it is and it was a reporter and then apparently they threw it had him thrown in jail and he was all mad because it was on the internet it was channel 10 news but they live streamed on the internet and all of a sudden Bubbles got this call and he said that people from Minneapolis have a fan club and he was like he was shocked they actually have a fan club right and they said that what they were going to do is they were going to pay for Ricky's bail that they all went down to Minneapolis to perform a live show right well they went into the police station where he's arrested they paid the bail money and then he got on and Ricky's like what are you guys doing here what are you doing and he said that well apparently we have a fan club in Minneapolis and they said they wanted us to come there and buy it and perform a show and Rick said man I can't do that I gotta buy Christmas for the wife and kids and stuff and Santa Claus is all pissed off at me and stuff like that because remember when I sucker punched him in the jaw and then Santa Claus kept punching me in the nuts and squeezing me and that's him playing with my nuts and stuff like that I got I gotta make it good with Santa's Jesus God guy and then Bubbles said well you know Minneapolis is actually North Pole you can go there and just make up to Santa Claus right there and he's like really because he still believes in Santa Claus and he and Bubbles tricked him into thinking that uh that Minneapolis was the North Pole so they go down there and it's uh Bubbles, Julie and Ricky, Randy and Officer Fahey and then Officer Fahey is mad because he thinks because Randy's working with Julian and then he thinks that they have a thing going and then because Officer Fahey and Randy are supposed to have a thing going between them you know what I mean and they go and they perform in front of a bunch of people and they do stuff like they do a version of Christmas care and all this other stuff and uh believe me you're not gonna want to eat onion rings again after seeing the one thing that they had and they go through a bunch of it's a big concert from I don't want to give away a lot of the comedy it's pretty funny and my dad absolutely hates Trail Park Boys because I watched it I mean because we have a big TV set up and then he always complains about the movies and stuff he just wants to watch football and baseball that's it he hates the Trail Park Boys but in the world's in the in the words of Bubbles as far as this movie is it's decent freaking decent no it's really good it's a very entertaining film brand new comedy special on Netflix I give it a nine out of ten for Trail Park Boys live in New York now a couple of other movies I wanted to review was Toxic Bender Park 2 now I've seen this a long time ago and on popcorn flicks they offered it uncut because I remember seeing the uh when it came out I remember seeing that on Warner Brothers video of all places this is back when still when uh Trum was still had Trum was still big because they they really had a hit hit with some uh some moves like Stuck on You and uh especially Class Nukum High and Toxic Bender playing the theaters and drive-ins you know it apparently had a lot of money and then uh Lloyd Kaufman went out he was giving a couple million dollars and he ended up shooting like five hours worth of footage and also the Sergeant Kabuki Man moved uh stuff in Tokyo and then he ended up splitting up uh making two movies out of the three four hours worth of footage he shot for Toxic Bender right and that's why they look Toxic Bender 2 and 3 look a lot alike except Toxic Bender 2 he goes to Tokyo and this is basically uh him going to Tokyo and then a bunch of funny stuff happens in there's lots of uncut gore not a lot but there is some in there I assume that's still the uncut version I'm assuming that is uh and it's very entertaining I give that a nine and a half out of ten it's very silly but very entertaining very Troma-esque if you will and then I saw uh Redemption a movie with uh on Netflix and then also I'm a big Jason Statham fan Jason Statham fan and basically this is trying to be some of his character as a fighter and stuff like that but done in a different way he uh was a vet from Afghanistan and then he's facing court martial and he's living in Japan right now and uh he suffered from PSD really bad he was homeless he gets beaten up by these guys and he escapes he ends up going to this guy's apartment and the guy's away till October 1st and this was like say like in May or something like that right so he's got a few months he ends up cleaning himself up getting a suit getting a job and there's this soup kitchen that he's kind of in love with and he and uh he ends up becoming like an enforcer for the mob Japanese mob and he's doing a bunch of stuff and with extra money he's making he's helped giving to the money to this nun to help the homeless and stuff and he likes this one girl and she gets killed and he goes after her killers a bunch of other stuff happens I don't want to give away but it's it's a very different more drama filled uh less action but more drama it's not bad the ending leaves you kind of cold though I'd probably give that Redemption of seven out of ten it's pretty good but very different for him but he played he's he's a good actor he can play dramatic roles too but there you have the main thing is Trailer Park Boys live from New York brand new comedy special for Netflix if you get a chance you should see it it's pretty good it's pretty entertaining so until next time take care my legion all right I'm out and I shouldn't say that but take care everybody"

Your father saved my life. Dean says you're a fair guy. Boys. I've had a rather emotional day, so whatever you're doing, you're not going to get away with it. I'm going to get away with it. I'm going to get away with it. I'm going to get away with it. I'm going to get away with it. I'm going to get away with it. I'm going to get away with it. I'm going to get away with it.

They use you and they will throw you to the fire. Why choose them? If you see a witch, kill it. We're not all evil you know. This is your most important test. Use everything I taught you. Show me what you are! That's disgusting. What does that kill? Cowardice."
120392," I had a very vivid dream the other night about us. What was it about, this dream? It was a dream of memories. I was wondering if I could have your number. She's with me. No, she's not. They were just memories of us over the years. You believe in love, I don't. So let's put it to the test. Date each other. You're not impressing me. I disagree. I don't mind your pessimism as much as I usually mind pessimism. That's great. I hate people who think I'm too negative. Wait. We'll say what you were gonna say and then maybe we should, like, not talk for a minute. I'm probably gonna fall in love with you. This feels like a dream. This is not a dream. Why wouldn't you want this always? It's always as scary. I never thought love was real. Now I think life isn't real without it. I blame your life for this. This is what happens when you put on love in Los Angeles. Why am I so hell bent on getting you back? I still have an AOL account. I don't want to be with a person like that. Why does it feel so impossible to let you go? I don't belong in a world where we don't end up together. I won't let you go, I promise you. There are parallel universes out there. You are with me.

There are things I've done in my life, and I was always ready to face the consequences. To protect my family. What do you know? What I know is soon everyone you love will be dead. What's your first priority here, Inspector? My job is to bring you in. My first priority is to protect the only one I have left. What are you going to do? I'm going to finish this. If you go down this road, the LAPD, the FBI, the CIA, they're all gonna come for you. They'll find you, and they'll stop you. Good luck. Hey movie fans, Valerie here with a cool Avengers movie fact.

121113," In every horror movie, there is a phone waiting to ring. Hello? A victim waiting to scream. A killer waiting to strike. Perfect. Just perfect. And a spoof dying to get made. Damn! But in the spoof of a spoof, Yo, what's up? the killer is getting dumber. Did you guys hear that is? R was sliced, diced, fried and hung. Jesus. I'm never gonna get laid. And the students are scared stupid. Bottom line is we're all in danger. Somehow, the killer always knows where we are. Let's go, man. What? I'm sure it could have been any one of us. Shut up! How many times do you think we've heard that in our lives, huh? Well, at least I feel safe here. Hi, Chuckie. Wanna play? This time, there are certain rules you have to follow if you want to survive.

This never happened. No, I just ate."
121126," Evil has visited the Earth in many forms. Now it returns as the car. There was no driver in the car. The car possessed. I know why he didn't go into the cemetery. The ground was hallowed. Who knows what it wants? Oh no, nothing can stop the car. There's nowhere to turn. Nowhere to hide. No way to stop the car. I think I hear the engine of that car. It's around here somewhere. I'm scared. No, I promise I won't go out. Tell me what to do, baby. What evil force drives the car?"
121171," In the traditional motion picture story, the villains are usually defeated. The ending is a happy one. I can make no such promise for the picture you're about to watch. I was born in Soviet Union. It was pretty rough. No running water, no toilets. You know, we got the fish only one day a week. It was Thursday. I was a happy kid. I played games, played hockey. Hockey was the most popular sport in the Soviet Union. From childhood, they picked out the best of the best of the best. It was politics, really. The game for them wasn't just the game. It was also propaganda. Cold War passions are running very, very hot. Soviet military forces have invaded Afghanistan. The sport were, in a way, a kind of warfare. You practice four times a day. The players had to live isolated 11 months of the year. They never get out of that camp. Andrey Kamatov's father was going to die. He came and said, can you let me see my father? I said, no, you have to get ready for the next game. The KGB guys were always there. He was screaming, yelling. He tried to play for our enemies. I said, send you to Siberia, you never get out. Why are you suffering so much? Why you play for the guy who doesn't respect us as a human being? The people running in this country, they were created by the Soviet system. Much of the problems are still anchored in that past. The individual had no say. My childhood dream come true. I cannot run away from my country. What if we offer you a million dollars cash? Then would you come and play in the NHL?"
121231," I used to daydream about being old enough to go on dates. I had this image of myself holding hands with a really cute guy, driving along some pretty road. It was never about going anywhere really. I was having some sort of freedom I guess. Jay, are you awake? What are you doing? You're not going to believe me, and I need you to remember what I'm saying. This thing, it's going to follow you. Somebody gave it to me, and I passed it to you. Wherever you are, it's somewhere walking straight for you. All you can do is pass it along to someone else. I'm scared. I need to find him. What did he really do to you? Apparently he used a fake name to rent a house in the city. This isn't real, I swear to you, this is just some game. If it kills her, it gets me, and goes straight down the line to whoever started it. What exactly is supposed to be following you? I don't know. Something happened. It's not what she thinks, okay? You don't believe me. Mom? No, it's me. Everything's okay. It could look like someone you know, or it could be a stranger in a crowd. Whatever helps, it gets close to you."

Die gleichen Haare, alles. Hast du schon mal jemanden getroffen? Dann hast du das Gefühl gehabt, dass du diese Person schon ein Leben lang vermisst? So als hättest du alles nur geträumt. Und dann wachst du endlich auf. Fragst du dich manchmal, was die Leute alles getan haben, dass es ihnen so schlecht geht? Wach auf! Welche, diese Äufe oder die Schläge? Es geht im Leben nicht um Liebe, mein Schatz. Wenn du es nicht mehr aushältst, gibt es nur zwei Dinge, die du tun kannst. Einatmen und ausatmen. Was sagt denn nicht deine Frau zu der Sache mit Dr. Tod? Mag sein, dass sie den Tod bringt, aber sie leckt willes. Zwischen 2 und 14 habe ich mich die meiste Zeit im Auto versteckt, weil ich gefunden werden wollte. Nach den Augen zu. Hörst du die Sekunden vorbeirasen? Ich höre sie die ganze Zeit. Alles wird gut. Du musst nur atmen."

122932," Why are people always so pissed off? Who's pissed off? Other than you. I'm not. Hello. I'm Elsa. I'm Elsa Hayes. I live in the apartment A right around the corner. Fred. The path to life is long. Who says that? Gandhi? Mother Teresa of Calcutta? Rocky Balboa? It's baby steps. One step after the other. I'd like to go home. I don't like parks. Where are you taking me? Do you trust me or not? You're not being as blind. On the count of three, we're going to get up. We're currently living in... Are you mad? Have you seen the old couple? They were sitting on table five. Yes, that's me when I was young. We look quite a bit alike. I told Fred I was a widow. Mom, why? I don't know, I just said, I doubt. Don't make the same mistake I made. She confuses reality with her imagination. She lives in this dream world. You know what Pablo said to me? Pablo who? Picasso. He said what you should do is mock death and then she will be afraid of you. Good evening. Baby, I hope someone that's a friend. I never did understand when friendship ends in love. She is not good for you. Look at you. You're all red. So I'm red, so what? What would you prefer, green, blue? The fact that even you have a love life gives me hope for my future. Why can't I have a love life? When I check her, check her. What do you think? What can I say? Tell me, did you have anything to drink tonight or eat any rich foods, experience any strong emotions? All of the above in under two hours."
123947," I made a list. And then I checked on the internet to see if they were different in Mexico. This is a lot. If I just update the small city, I think you have big problems. Perceptivo. How's it going? I'm doing really well. I want you to verbalize to Nina how her suicide affected you. She jumped off the freeway overpass, landed on a flatbed truck heading to Mexico. Her body got stuck in customs for like a week before Nina's husband could even claim it. Way to go, Nina. Spread your legs a little bit wider. Should we go on a date first? Ha ha. Listen, you think I could come by and pick up the rest of my stuff? It's prudent if we don't see each other. Nice night, huh? I came here for Nina's address. I can't give you that information. I actually brought you a really nice bottle of vodka. What kind? For Nina's husband. Yeah. I'm not a stalker. I mean, not in the traditional sense. You know, you just could have said you wanted to come over. Yeah, but what's the fun in that? Way. What are you doing? He doesn't even like you. I know about your accident. I can't save you. I could barely save myself and my kid. I'm not asking you to. He's in it. Are you so mad? No, say. Get off my property. If I could switch places, I would. I wanted to tell you that. Get out! Get out! Get out! Make a wish. I can't think of anything. Doesn't matter. Just blow them out. I am in a lot of pain. Do you want to get better? Really? Say it, Claire. I do."

Now what I want is $260,000 in cash. Is everything okay? When someone needs that amount of money in cash, nothing's okay. Birth, education, intelligence. Just do it. 21. Talent. Again. Player wins. I've seen you be half a million dollars up. I've been up two and a half million dollars. You got me feeling lucky. I'm putting everything on black. Your husband coming up all night. You want me to pay you now? Maybe I enjoy watching the show. 19 red. What's wrong with you? You got brain damage? Rough way to start the week. Will you take away nothing else from my class? Desiring a thing cannot make you have it. I want to go to a restaurant. I need you to leave. Because I've seen you in your other life? You owe money to places you shouldn't. Why do you want door number three? It's the only way I'll get out. I've said goodbye before to people I love. Whatever did happen today. Let's just deal with this gentleman who understand each other, please. No. I need for us to treat each other like we're not gentlemen and that we're very, very stupid. What'll they do to you if you don't pay? Break every bone in my body? How am I gonna get my money, Jim? I look like a magician. You must have thought you was magic occasionally. If I have to pull you into an inappropriate relationship to get you out of your job, I'm ready to go. So am I. What if I told you that I'm not a gambler? A real love, a real thing to do every day and I'd just rather die if I don't get it. I just say that out loud. If I give you this money and you don't pay me back, there are no rules.

I have a natural instinct for what makes a person tick. Anastasia? Christian. You do realize that he hasn't stopped looking at you? Have you met someone? Hay Free. I like to see your face. Gives me some clue what you might be thinking. So you're a control freak? I exercise control in all things. It must be really boring. You're not playing fair. You should just get clear of me. I'm not the man for you. Why won't you let me in? I had a rough start in life. That's all you need to know. My tastes are very singular. You wouldn't understand. Enlighten me then. Why are you trying to change me? I'm not. It's you that's changing me. I don't know if I can be with him the way he needs me to. Say I did stay. What would happen?"
126006," You know sure and answer and prancer and Vixen, Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen. But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all? Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose. And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows. All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names. They'd never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games. Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say, Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight? Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee, Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history. It was the day before Christmas and all through the hills the reindeer were playing, enjoying the spills of skating and coasting and climbing the willows and hopscotch and leapfrog, protected pillows. Look fellas, it's Rudolph. His nose is a sight. It's red as a bee. Twice as big and twice as bright. Looky, looky, I'm Rudolph. Poor Rudolph, where most reindeers' noses are brownish and tiny, Rudolph's was red, very large and quite shiny. Rudolph! Go on home, red-nosed, your mama's calling you. Come, come Rudolph. Tonight you hang up your stockings. His nose is a sight. It's red as a bee. Twice as big and twice as bright. While way, way up north on this dark, foggy night, awaiting the time for his Christmas Eve flight, good old Santa, This fog will be hard to get through. Quick, quick, get his in a hurry. Dasher, dancer, prancer, fixer, comet, cupid, donner, lesser. Right ho! Keep our direction, we'll have to fly low. Come down here, quick. Right ho! Oh, pretty close. Right ho! The air was still foggy the night dark and clear when Santa arrived at the home of the deer. But all this took time and filled Santa with gloom while slowly he groped toward the next reindeer's room. The lamp wasn't burning, the glow came instead from Rudolph's red nose at the head of the bed. And then came the greatest idea in all history. So Rudolph is told of the dark and delayed... I need you tonight to lead all my deer on the rest of our flight. Dear Mommy and Daddy, I have gone to help Santa. Don't worry, Rudolph, that's me. Hi Rudolph, it's very dark here. Santa? With Rudolph's red nose as a wonderful light, old Santa flew quickly the rest of the night. It all went so fast that before it was day, the very last present was given away. Hear ye, hear ye, a message from Rudolph. Yes, they'd found Rudolph's message. It's a message from Santa Claus. Santa Claus? Hear ye, hear ye, a message from Rudolph. Yes, they'd found Rudolph's message. It's all over town. Hear ye, hear ye, Rudolph, at the stadium. Come on, come on. The bad deer who used to do nothing but tease him? Well, now they'd do anything only to please him. Rudolph, my boy, they'll envy you now far and near. But no greater honor can come to a deer than riding with Santa and guiding my sleigh, the number one job on the number one day. I hope you'll continue to keep us from grief. I hereby appoint you Commander of the Santa Claus Company. And Rudolph just blushed from his head to his toes until his old fur was as red as his nose. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night. Merry Christmas to you, Santa Claus. Merry Christmas to you, Santa Claus. Merry Christmas to you, Santa Claus. Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee, Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history."

They were pass Would you dance for me? So, what were you doing at an Irish dance? I'm really like Irish girls I met somebody an Italian fella We're going to Coney Island at the weekend. Do you have a baby costume? Why didn't we tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes? I want to ask you something and you're gonna say always too soon. Will you come for dinner and meet my family? I'd love to like Italian food. I'm gonna say splash anytime.

127114," When I think of this trip, I see David and me in the front seat of his car. He wants something better than he has. I want precisely what he has already. David. Wallace. Welcome to Minneapolis. Hi, I'm David Lewis. Oh, hi. Okay, David and David. We only just met. He's writing a piece on the tour. What's this story about in your mind? Just what it's like to be the most talked about writer in the country, that sort of thing. You're like a nervous guy, huh? No, no, no. No, I'm okay. How are you? I'm, because I'm terrified. I gotta ask, what is with the bandana? I know that it's a security blanket for me whenever I'm kind of afraid my head is going to explode. If we ate like this all the time, what would be wrong with that? It's like good, seductive commercial entertainment, like Die Hard. First Die Hard? Great film. No, it's a brilliant film. The best. Hey, isn't it reassuring to have a lot of people read you? I think if the book is about anything, it's about the question of why. Why am I doing it? And what's so American about what I'm doing? If the responding to your work and your work is really personal, then reading you is another way of meeting you, isn't that right? That's so good. Thank you. I think that if there's a sort of sadness for people under 45, it has something to do with pleasure and achievement and entertainment, like a sort of emptiness at the heart of what they thought was going on. I got a real serious fear of being a certain way. I treasure my regular guy-ness. You don't crack open a thousand page book because you heard the author was a regular guy. You do it because he's brilliant. What is with you? What is with you? I'm not so sure you want to be me. Just be a good guy. The more people think you're really great, the bigger the fear of being a fraud is. David thought books existed to stop you from feeling lonely. Living those days with him reminded me of what life is like. And the conversation is the best one I ever had. It's me, talking as a tape recorder. I'm smoking. Just that I wouldn't smoke, I'm smoking. Just me and your tape recorder."
127124," Is this your first time? Yeah. Same. What are your interests? Um... I'm gonna cut to the chase here if that's okay. Sex is still very important to me.

You seem, um... He thought I was dead. You are a good drinking buddy. Guys ask about you all the time, Carol. Don't start with the second husband talk. Couldn't pay me. But they do pay you when they die. You don't need all that. It's right the way you are. Is there any karaoke around tonight? Now you say you're lonely. Growing old was the furthest thing from my mind. You've had a great life, Mom. You had a great husband and a career in music. It's all in the past tense. And you're the best of what I have, you and Dad. I want to have lunch with you. What's your name? Yes. Your name is Yes? Carol. I'm Bill. People that retire with all their money, they don't want to do themselves. I didn't want to end up like that. I don't like being alone. Is there something you'd like to share with the group? I don't know what the hell I'm doing. People can spend their whole lives trying to find that feeling. And at the end, everybody gets it. Because I cried a river over you. Hey, actually, do you still have any of that medical marijuana? It's got to warm up. I know what I'm doing. All right, all right. Let's get this going. Are you guys having a party? No. No."

130351," When we're ready to sing, we step up the microphones and it comes out something like this. We came in the studios with Levi's and T-Church smoking cigarettes. The older guys were saying they're going to wreck the music business. In the hardcore producing area, everybody knew what went on there. I mean, everybody knew that the best musicians played in all the sessions, but we as the general public didn't know. They played so well and they played so well together. I was in awe then because of Phil Spector. I pulled my car over the side of the road and said, what am I listening to here? The musicians were really the unsung heroes of all those hit records. When I listen to the record, it is so apparent that these guys were just really so good, and you can see why everybody used them. The ranking crew was the focal point of the music. They were the ones with all the spirit and all the know-how. We made up a lot of rands ourselves. We would either augment or totally replace a group. The public was oblivious that there was a secret star maker machinery. I had no idea that people didn't play their own records until the monkeys came along. We were so busy. I was making more money than the president of the United States. Seven records of the year was unbelievable. Here's the way that the beat goes on sounded when we first heard it. La de da da da. Yeah, I saw. The third line I came up with was... They were the stone cold rock and roll professionals, and there may never be a group of that caliber again. Let's go!"

None of us know how to help you. Please stop reminding me that something's wrong. You look like hell. Thanks. Maybe she wants you to go after her. No she doesn't. Wait a couple of days and go after her. She's up. I need to try some other version of myself. I'll never get to where we were. Where was that? Some place good. Would you still love me if I couldn't pay for dinner? I'm going to leave first. Run run run! If you walk away from things, start a whole history of walkaways. Everything seems so limitless.

Let me think. We don't have a map. We don't have a cellphone. We are in the middle of nowhere. What is that? That? Oh, that's acorns. It's falling from the trees on a tap. That's not an acorn. I don't know what that is. It's a tree. It's a tree. It's a tree. It's a tree. It's a tree. It's a tree. It's a tree. It's a tree. No! Behind me! Come on! you"

130970," But this, if you isolate one of them, you sit them down rationally and you talk to them about the low IQs and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions. Right away they start talking about education. That's the big answer to everything. Education. They say we need more money for education. We need more books, more teachers, more classrooms, more schools. We need more testing for the kids. You say to them, well, you know, we've tried all of that and the kids still can't pass the test. They say, oh, don't you worry about that. We're going to lower the passing grades. And that's what they do in a lot of these schools now. They lower the passing grades so more kids can pass. More kids pass. The school looks good. Everybody's happy. The IQ of the country slips another two or three points. And pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a fucking pencil. Got a pencil? Get the fuck in there. It's physics. Then everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do. Education. Politicians know that word. They use it on you. Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things. The flag, the Bible, and children. No child left behind. No child left behind. Oh, really? Well, it wasn't long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start. Head start, left behind. Someone's losing fucking ground here. But there's a reason. There's a reason. There's a reason for this. There's a reason education sucks. And it's the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed. It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. You're going to be happy with what you got. Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now. The real owners. The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls. They've got the judges in their back pockets. And they own all the big media companies. So they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interest. That's right. They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don't want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now they're coming for your Social Security money. They want your fucking retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. And you know something? They'll get it. They'll get it all from you sooner or later because they own this fucking place. It's a big club and you ain't in it. You and I are not in the big club. By the way, it's the same big club they used to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe all day long, beating you over the head in their media, telling you what to believe, what to think, and what to buy. The table is tilted, folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good honest, hardworking people, white collar, blue collar, doesn't matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest, hardworking people, continue. These are people of modest means. Continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don't give a fuck about them. They don't give a fuck about you. They don't give a fuck about you. They don't care about you at all. At all. At all. Man. You know? And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white, and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes every day. Because the owners of this country know the truth. It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it."

Here in a lonely desert tavern, fate draws together a strange company. Alan Squire, a vagabond adventurer running away from his past. Gabrielle Maple, a beautiful girl weary of the desert solitude, eager to escape with the first man who comes her way. Boaz Hammond, an ex-football hero, down on his luck. Paul Chisholm, multimillionaire banker, vacationing with his disillusioned young wife, Dorothy. Grant Maple, a sly old reprobate. And Duke Mante, vicious leader of an notorious band of gunmen, hiding out after a gang massacre. In a short space of 24 eventful hours, these characters live a lifetime of romance, adventure, terror, and tragedy. It's one of the most unusual stories ever brought to the screen, the petrified forest. Well, if you must know, I'll tell you the extent of my pride. Gabrielle gave me this dollar. You did? It's none of your business. Would you like to know what she was going to give me when those rats showed up? Would you like to know? Well, speaking of rats, of all the logs, slimy steam. Now, Gabrielle, now you mustn't blame Boaz. You must remember, he's a man of muscle. He's suffering from the pangs of frustration. I said you were a dirty load. I'm sorry, Gabby. I didn't mean it. Honest, I didn't. They've got me absolutely crazy mad with all those guns staring me in the face. Shut up, Boaz. Step over to the other side of the room, half-back.

But I do know what it means to repress yourself and starve yourself. What were you saying? I'm telling you for your own good, Mante. They know where you're heading and they've picked up your trail. And they'll get you. What's the matter with you, Duke? Do something! Shut up! Shut up! Give me time to think. No, Duke, you want revenge, don't you? You want to go out of your way again to get that blonde who snitched. Well, don't do it, Duke. She has snitched. Come on, Duke. I told you to shut up. You know they're going to get you anyway. You're obsolete, Duke, like me. You've got to die. Well, then die for freedom that's worth it. Don't give up your life for anything so cheap and unsatisfactory as revenge.

Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host, that he which hath no stomach to this feast, let him depart. His passport shall be drawn, and crowns for convoy put into his purse. We would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us. This day is called the feast of Crispian. He that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand at tiptoe when this day is named, and rouse him at the name of Crispian.

Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars, and say, These wounds I had on Crispian's day. Old men forget, yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day. Then shall our names, familiar in his mouth as household words, Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester, be in their flowing cups, freshly remembered. This story shall the good man teach his son, and Crispian Crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered. We few, we happy few, we band of brothers, for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother, be he ne'er so base, and gentlemen in England now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here, and hold their manhoods cheap whilst any speaks that fought with us upon St. Crispian's day."

25940," Hi, I'm Joe Dante. About a year ago we did a Trailers from Hell live show where a bunch of gurus got up in front of an audience and basically talked about whatever trailer they wanted to talk about and having not previewed it was all extemporaneous. And Larry Cohen really dumped, rather eloquently, on Lady from Shanghai. I thought he really went a little overboard myself, but then I started thinking about it and I realized that's kind of the profile that the movie has. Considering the fact that what we have to look at isn't remotely what was intended by Orson Welles, I think it's worth taking a look at this trailer just to get a little better idea of what was really supposed to be going on. There's a good story about how Welles was asked on the phone by Columbia Pictures' president Harry Cohen what picture he wanted to make and he spotted, If I Should Die Before I Wake by Sherwood King, a paperback on a nearby drugstore rack and chose it without reading it. Actually the book had been found by William Castle, whose B-movies had impressed Cohen and had hoped to direct this himself. But Welles co-opted it and took it to Cohen, who handed Castle the treatment and said, You know, Bill, it takes a genius like Orson Welles to find material like this. The stories of its making and unmaking are legion and can be accessed elsewhere, but the bottom line is that the movie is released as a pale shadow of what was intended. It was re-cut, re-dubbed, re-shot, re-mixed and burdened by an insistent music score that Welles hated. So now it's a movie of brilliant parts but no cohesion. But what memorable parts? The aquarium, the Alice in Wonderland trial, the Hall of Mirrors shootout, the crazy house, the Kabuki theater, and that has Glenn Anders as Grisby, the atom bomb-phobe who plots his own murder and gives one of the most unforgettably creepy performances in a Welles film. Cohen was not interested in cinematic flourishes. He wanted a showy vehicle for his star, Welles' soon-to-be ex-wife, Rita Hayworth, now sporting short blonde hair that annoyed Cohen no end. The result is an art film ineffectually shoehorned to fit into a standard studio box. And although it's still worth watching, it's really only as a remnant of what might have been. We did manage over the years to find a reconstituted version of Welles' next mutilated movie, Macbeth, but for Lady from Shanghai, I don't think we'll be that lucky. No further questions."

26003," I think Renate was trying to explore the Holocaust as a way of sounding a universal moral warning. That's what he's doing at the end of the film when he says, humanity's cry is all around us but we're not listening now. And I think that he's particularly sensitive that the Holocaust and many atrocities, many other atrocities have been justified through racism. So he deliberately avoids any kind of racial categories in discussing what happens. He talks about Nazis and he talks about prisoners, acknowledging that there were more than just Jews among the prisoners and there were more than just Germans among the Nazis. In fact, he faced real censorship over one shot where you can identify one of the Nazi soldiers as a French soldier from his cap. And because this would be obvious to any French viewer watching the film, he was told he had to obscure that shot or lose the whole last 10 minutes of the movie. And of course, faced with that dilemma, he obscured the shot. Now that's been restored, the original shot. But he's saying, we have done this. This has happened all across Europe and we are, as France, I think in this evoking of the war in Algeria, we're doing this now in Africa. And this is something that human beings do to each other. And I'm going to resist the language and the categories that have been used to justify this crime."

Business, my lord. Who shared his most intimate secrets. I must say I adore my French possessions. They're certainly worth recapturing. Until Beckett the man was made a bishop and his king lost him to God. Beckett, the story of one of the bitterest personal feuds known to history, reveals the heartbreak, the conflict and conspiracy that engulfed the lives of a king and the one man he favored above all others. Starring Richard Burton as Beckett, Peter O'Toole as his king. I would have gone to war with all England's might behind me and even against England's interest to defend you Thomas. I would have given away my life laughingly for you. Only I loved you. You didn't love me. That's the difference. Human passions at their best and their worst. Quick, out through the window. They are revealed in the story of Beckett. Here are the escapades that brought a blush to their country's face as they wenched and brawled their way across the pages of history. Thomas! Thomas, come here! Look at this. She stinks a bit, but we can wash her. What would you think of it? Cleaned up a little. Richard Burton as Beckett. You are my lord, God or no God. I would have come with you. For you had taken my heart before you captured my body. Beckett, the man of the world who became Archbishop of Canterbury and enemy of the king. Gentlemen, it is a supreme irony that the worldly Beckett, the profligate and libertine, should find himself standing here at this moment. But here he is, in spite of himself.

To the devil and my whole family if he have you. Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest? Are all around me cowards like myself? Are there no men left in England? Jealousy, akin to madness that breeds incitement to murder. Vengeance that bites into the very flesh. One does not carry arms into God's house. Don't! What do you want? Your death. The story of Beckett is recorded here, right up to the last brutal bloody act."
26116," Charlotte. Charlotte. Oh, no! The winners of five prior Academy awards and 21 Academy nominations now bring you... ...suspense unequaled in the history of the screen. Shock that will leave you speechless. Charlotte, what have you done? Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte. Charlotte, don't you cry. Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte. I'll love you till I die. Yes, I told you. And I told your father too. Why wouldn't I tell him that his pure, darling little girl... ...was having a dirty little affair with a married man? You're a vile, sorry little tramp! How was I to know it would end in murder? But it didn't end with murder, it just began. What was the warped and twisted thing that turned this house into a nightmare? Where do you think you're going? I'm going upstairs and I'm gonna tell her what you've been up to. What's going on up there that you don't want me to see? Now come on. Don't you think I know what you're looking for in my house? But what does it matter if you haven't anything to conceal? Oh, but I have. I have things concealed. Vile things. Where do you suppose I keep them? Haven't you guessed? You know what it's cost me not to kill you. Let me tell you, Miriam, dearie, that murder starts in the heart. Don't turn on the light. It's only real when it's dark. I won't turn on the light. Come along. Ah! He's dead! He's dead! He's dead! Damn you! Now will you shut your mouth? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!"

Who boasted there was nothing that moved that he couldn't handle. And Sheila moved. You have a better idea? Unconditional surrender. Ronald Reagan as Browning. Who planned a million dollar heist and got more than he bargained for."

26125," Hi, I'm Jack Hill and this is Trailers from Hell. And the trailer we're going to be showing right now is a film that I might, my first feature film made in 1964 called Spider Baby. The original, well, it's called Spider Baby or The Maddest Story Ever Told. The original title, unfortunately, was Cannibal Orgy or The Maddest Story Ever Told, cuz I thought that was funny. And there was a movie at that time showing in theaters called The Maddest Story Ever Told, so it was a joke, an in-joke sort of, of the time. Anyway, Spider Baby it is and Spider Baby it became. And the person who later distributed the picture, who came up with the title Spider Baby, I consider a genius for that. Because this title is perfect. This particular trailer didn't exist at the time the picture was made, in this form that you will see it now. Originally, there was a soundtrack of a voiceover. The trailer was just a single scene from the movie without any dialogue track, with a narration over it. It was the worst trailer anybody has ever seen. Now, when Quentin Tarantino wanted to re-release my film Switchblade Sisters, he wanted to put a DVD out that would have scenes or trailers from all my films. And so Spider Baby was a bit of a problem because the trailer was so horrible. So what he did was to have his editor use the original narration track from the trailer. And they cut in their favorite moments and favorite scenes from the picture to fit it. And that's the trailer as it exists today, only on the DVD. Well, maybe it'll be shown in theaters someday, who knows? We can take a look, Spider Baby. Spider Baby was my first feature film, and it was shot in 1964 in 12 days for a cost of about $55,000. And it was Lon Chaney's last sober film, I believe, as they tell me. And he loved the script so much he wanted to do a good job with it, and he did. His acting in this film was just absolutely marvelous. It shows how good an actor he really was. And he also fell in love with the cast. The two young girls in this picture were just absolutely delightful. Jill Banner who plays the Spider Baby was 17 and had never done anything in films before at all. The other actress was Beverly Washburn, who had been a child star since she was very, very young and had had 20 years of experience. And the two of them played off of each other just like solid professionals. Unfortunately, the film was not released at the time that it was made because the producers who were in the real estate development business went into bankruptcy. And the film was locked up in a vault for four years. It did get released, but it was kind of consigned to oblivion until it was discovered many, many years later on home video."

26151," I've often thought that Brayson is a director that appeals to each person so individually that everybody has his or her own personal vision of what it is that the director has done. You don't have to like him or not, but you've got this vision. The people who revere him are numerous enough to have formed a group. I'm obviously a member of this group. I take friends of mine to see a revival of Brayson and I tell them, now you've got to watch this. This is some film only to have them fall asleep or start yawning uncontrollably or afterwards the films are over. They go, Jesus Christ. Now obviously these are friends of mine. They share something with me. We have something going or else we wouldn't be friends with each other. And yet we have such opposite reactions to the films of Brayson. And I think that's an indication of the strength of Brayson is that he calls forth emotions to the extent that you reveal yourself in a strange kind of way with Brayson. I'm not saying that I'm better because I cry or that my friend is worse because he goes to sleep. I'm simply saying that the wavelength of Brayson indicates that you have to go deeper into yourself and see Brayson than you usually do in the films of most directors. Is it a Rorschach test? I don't know. But there are enough people who are sort of convinced by what he shows us that they first are willing and later look forward to, I've seen Brayson, how many times have I seen Ozard Balthazar? Oh many many times because I like what it does to me. It's like traveling. You go to a city where you like yourself. I think maybe you go to a movie where you like yourself. Another reason maybe for the persuasiveness of Brayson is the fact he's the only director that I know of that addresses our two senses simultaneously. He never short changes them. Usually most directors are going to show us this or we're going to make us listen to that. In the case of Brayson, they're pretty well balanced and sometimes the unexpected takes over. At the beginning of Ozard Balthazar, we get the whole thing and just in the sound we get the Schubert sonata. We get the background noises, nature. They're out in the old country home and this is broken by Dunkey's Bray. So they've got the whole story right there. So he uses sound to do what? Encapsulate his meanings. Look at the ending of Ozard Balthazar where without any comment at all just sounds the soaring of the wind, the bells of the sheep and then the miraculous entry of the main theme from the Schubert as closure. Then we watch what this causes and this causes Balthazar to gently kneel down and die before our very eyes. He moves in mysterious ways to create an emotional ambience that means that I find it impossible to look at the final scenes of this picture without crying. I mean for a picture to have this effect upon one time and time again argues for something which I really don't understand. But when the Schubert starts and the Dunkey collapses and the sheep gather and the little bells sound, the combination of you know something awful and something wonderful going together defeats any critical acumen I may have and it reduces me to the emotional human being which I think was Bray's intention in making this picture."
26157," We're almost there honey, just a little while longer and your vacation's done. Up inside this magic circle keeps your head up high. I wonder where they're going. Man, like there's nothing up that road. I could have sworn we didn't make a wrong turn. You must have. Where did the road go? No need to get upset, we'll find it. You know we should have asked for better directions at the last gas station. Listen, I've never gotten this lost before. Now look, the sign pointed this way. Mike, let's go back to the crossroads and ask those kids we saw. Okay, okay, but I know we can't be wrong. Look, the sign pointed this way. Where did this place come from? It wasn't here a few minutes ago. I don't care, let's see if we can get some directions. I am Torgo. I take care of the place while the master is away. We only want to know where Valley Lodge is. Which way do we go? There is no way out of here. It will be dark soon. There is no way out of here. No way out? Well, you know, we could spend the night here and then tomorrow we could... Oh Mike, Mike, I don't want to spend the night here. I don't like the looks of the place. Well, it seems we have no alternative. Well, how about it, Torgo, can we spend the night here? I'll get the luggage. I'll be glad to leave. I've had all of this place I want. Madam, it will be very dangerous to leave now. The master wants you. Wants me? What kind of talk is that? He wants you for his wife. Arise my wives. Give ear to the words of Manos. Arise my wives. And hear the will of Manos. Mike, help us. Oh my God. Manos, God of primal darkness. As thou hast decreed, so have I done. The hands of faith have doomed this man. Thy will is done. Manos will be served. Thank you."
26163," I'm DA Penny Baker. And I'm Bob Newworth. Have you ever noticed how this particular short film has been co-opted so many times recently? Yeah. Dylan came up with the idea of having a lot of things written down on pieces of paper. We didn't think about what you're going to do with them, but he'd have these things on cards, and he said, is that a good idea for the film? And I said, it's a terrific idea. And that was when we decided to carry a whole lot of shirt things or whatever it was that we used. Shirt cardboards from the laundry. You know, they went back about 20 years later to re-inspect all the sites of the film, and they were still working on this alley. But who decided on what we were going to say on these cards? It's not like I remember Bob picked them. What's great about them is that they're puns within the cue cards themselves. I'm interested in the origins of the cue cards, because I didn't know that until you told me the other day how it began. With Scopitone in it? Yeah. Scopitone was that French invention where they could go to a jukebox and see a three-minute loop of Johnny Halliday or Francois Zardy. You put two Franks in and the thing... Exactly. And Bob wanted to have Scopitone to go with it. And he had no idea where it was going to play necessarily. No. They weren't equipped for Scopitone. We were a little ahead of our time. 25, 30 years. What's changed? I don't know. These cue cards were done by yourself and myself. Joan and Donovan. Everybody had a... I don't think Alan did. Wasn't Alan just along for the day? Isn't that Alan Ginsburg in the corner? Yeah, it is Alan. Alan came to sanctify us, I think. He came to check the writing."

Sorry, Dr. Bester. Dr. Bester! Dr. Bester, what do I want with basketballs? All right, Teach. Let's have that talk about my potential. You could be suspended for carrying that knife. Not unless someone turns me in. I want to talk about my potential. Yes, this is the book so funny and human, you didn't know if you were laughing or crying. Is this 322? Yes, you're late. I'm not late, I'm laughing. Please, you are? I was laughing all last term. Well, why don't you sit down? I can't sit down, I'm dropping out. I've come about that D you gave Royan on midterms. The trouble is, it is my wonder, General. Go on, say it. He goes to sleep. He goes to sleep? And that's why you gave him a D? That's how he gave himself a D. I wanted you to see him go. To work at 8.30 p.m. in that garage all night. He brings home all his money. But he wants to be good at being around cars, so he wants to graduate. He's got this made up mind about cars and graduation. But you don't graduate from nowhere with D's. Don't ever hurry down this block, just walk slowly. Even if you're frightened or late or it's raining, just walk slowly. And look, don't seem to, but look. This is where they spend 18 hours a day. We have them for six. It is dangerous here. Not the place for a girl like this, you'd say. But you'd be wrong, because this is where she fell in love. Oh, this is no ordinary love story. Not just another boy and girl. No, this is the story of a girl who fell in love with a monster. And here it is. Boys! Boys, please, sit down. Boys, please, sit down. Boys, please. They're all here. All the dangerous, harried, hateful, incredible and beautiful characters that have made Up the Down Staircase one of the best-loved bestsellers ever. And most unforgettably of all, there is Joe Ferroni. Joe, who had been sent to her with a warning. I want you to go home. Look, I'm here. Isn't that what you wanted? Always wanting to see me after school? Alone? Well, we're alone now. Joe, so brilliant and so dangerous. You finally got to me, teach. Joe. Joe, no. No."

Your name is Philip North. I'm Philip Beardsley. We all went to church when we were all married. I'm Philip Beardsley. No, dear, not legally. And we must sign our legal names in school, mustn't we? Beardsley. No, dear. No, no, no, no! Beardsley, no! No, no, no, no! Beardsley, no! I got here as fast as I could, Sister Mary. What is it this time? Why don't you ask Philip? Philip? Darling, what happened? Nothing. Who did that to you? One of the kids. But she started. He says I'm not legal. What? And Mike isn't my brother. Of course he's your brother. Then my name is Philip Beardsley. Philip North. There she goes again. Sister, couldn't you just call him Philip Beardsley? I'm sorry, but the school requires that we use their legal names. Let's go to another school. Sister, I understand your legal problem, but you must try to understand mine. You see, I'm trying to bring two families together. And this is the first sign that I may be succeeding. So I really would appreciate it if you'd let Philip sign his name Beardsley. But legally, it's North. But it's more important that emotionally, it's Beardsley. North. Beardsley. North. Beardsley, Beardsley, Beardsley. Watch out, Mom, you might get a black eye."

26325," The communist conspiracy is a deliberate and predictable plan of action to subvert the world. There are those who ask why this responsibility should be ours. The answer I think is simple. There's no one else who can do the job. We began to feel the sense of a world power that possibly we could control the future of the world. They don't see the end of the tunnel, but I must say I don't think it's darker than it was a year ago and in some ways lighter. Throughout the war in Vietnam, the United States has exercised a degree of restraint unprecedented in the annals of war. Five hundred thousand of them in Vietnam and this war became a war of genocide. Americans say the Vietnamese are just slant-eyed savages. The Vietnamese have five thousand years of history. We fight against the invaders. It is not we who are the savages. I know very little about it over there, I'll tell you. The less I know, the better off I'll be. I don't even know who we're fighting for over there to be real honest with you. I think we're fighting for the North Vietnamese, ain't we? How did I feel when the war was over? I felt real good. And that was our number one ambition. That was what we really wanted was to win this war. It took us a long time. So when it was finally over, when we knew that we had won, we felt great. We really felt great. I think Americans have worked extremely hard not to see the criminality their officials and their policymakers have exhibited. Make no mistake about it, we are going to win. The history of conflict among nations does not record another such lengthy and consistent chronicle of error as we have shown in Vietnam. The Vietnamese fight only in self-defense. Ultimately, the Americans will see the light. If not, they will defeat themselves. When the going gets tough, the tough get going because winners never quit and quitters never win.

26342," This past spring was the first that I felt tired and realized I was growing old. Maybe it was the rotten weather we'd had in L.A. Maybe it was the rotten cases I'd had, mostly chasing a few missing husbands and then chasing their wives once I found them in order to get paid. Or maybe it was just the plain fact that I am tired and growing old. The only real pleasure I'd had at all was following Joe DiMaggio, thought the Apple would be an incredible clip for the New York Yankees. Well, it's the middle of July now, and things are worse than they were in the spring. In the spring I wasn't holed up in a dingy hotel ducking the police. You got a name? Oh, Marlowe.

He told me he got my name from the telephone book. You expect us to believe that? What happened to the 15,000 Marion head on up? I bought the fence bonds. I'd like to know who killed him. When did you find out? Andrew, you got that picture? Yeah. Sheese! You look like you went 10 miles with your old... What I need is another drink. I need a lot of life insurance. I need a home in the country. I need a vacation. I'm tired, Nauhti. I've got a hat, a coat and a gun. That's it. Hello. It's me. I began to think you'd won the Irish sweepstakes and took off. What else were you thinking? I've been thinking about tonight. Why don't you meet me around nine? Where to? My place. What for? You got everything we need with you. I didn't sell him anything, Mr. Marlow. Every time I come close to getting some information from somebody, they get killed.

26366," Come, old young feller, so brave and so fine, Seek much fortune way down in the mine. Harlan, Kentucky is coal country where men work long hours for short wages, where poverty, black lung and needless disaster are facts of life. In 1973, the men voted to join the United Mine Workers Union. The company refused to sign the contract and so began the battle of Harlan County, USA. Without organization you are a lone individual, without implants and without recognition of any kind. They're treating us like we're animals, dogs, but we aren't, we're American citizens.

We were attempting to move our people into trailers, upgrade our people into better housing. We'll sit there and sweat when it's snowing. We'll stand right there to let UMWA contract it's signed at Brookside. We have made them dozens and dozens of proposals. All of our life we've been kicked around, we've been put in jail, we've been shot at, we've had dynamite thrown at us, and then you don't want us to have nothing. Well, I tell you, Mr. Horn, I'm going to be standing right there on that picket line looking at you just as long as it takes. You're not going to have the violence of the 30s. Don't suck a wild ass, Franky! My father was a coal miner, he was killed in the mines. And my husband and me was in the strike in the 30s in bloody Harlan County, and I do mean it is bloody too. They're violent, so by God you'd fight far with far. Go, go, go! We can hold them, but we can't hold them with all the guns they got. That led Christie burning over there, they're somebody dying every day for it. What the hell is going on over there? If I get shot, they can't shoot the Union out of me. Take the shelter if you can and lay the lead tall. Oh, death, oh death. The New York Times says it's a fascinating and moving work. Q Magazine calls it supercharged excitement. It's powerful, provocative, exciting, and frightening because it's real. Harlan County, USA."

26400," I had read an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, Dead Pets Go to Napa. So I read about how the pet cemetery is going under and that all the pets are going to be exhumed and transported in refrigerator trucks to another pet cemetery. So I thought I should be down there when the graves were being dug up. So I hastily tried to put together some kind of a crew. My first cameraman who came up from L.A., I fired him. The first day of production, we got into a fight because he told me I didn't know how to shoot this kind of thing, and he did. He wanted it all to be handheld camera. I didn't. I wanted a camera on a tripod, and at one point I pushed him into a grave, a partially exhumed dog grave. Everyone kept telling me that I was doing it all wrong. This is not the way to do it. This is not the way that it should be done. At some point I started to joke that I had taken all of the tenets of verite or direct cinema and just thrown them out the window. I've always been fascinated by the idea that there is a correct way to tell a story or there's a correct way to make a film. It's so stupid, it's hard to believe that people really believe it, but they do, that if you use available light and use a handheld camera and you don't move anything into or out of the frame, the truth will emerge, kind of an epistemological meat grinder. You just add the appropriate ingredients and truth results. Well, that makes no sense. It really makes no sense at all. It's a pursuit, it's a quest. You investigate, you look, you think, you study in the hope that you can learn something about the world. But to think that truth is connected with style, it's like saying, you know, I'm going to use a certain quality of tile in my shower and it will become more truthful as a result. It doesn't work that way. Who could have ever thought that it did?"

Poppy, which was the first film I did with Arthur Hill, it was a very, very moving, meaningful film for me. I loved working with him, so suggested him right off the bat for the in-laws. Everything about it works. I don't think there's a dead moment in the film. First of all, the script was brilliant. It just worked. It had an idea. It had an idea that stayed consistent throughout. It had an idea that developed as the script went on. Most comedies don't have that sense of developing, expanding idea. Comedies don't have that very much. When they do, they almost invariably work. You had a director who understood the script completely and played with it magnificently. You had a director who works beautifully with actors, who gives actors an enormous amount of freedom. You had two actors who had chemistry together from the beginning, very effortlessly and easily. So what can go wrong?"

Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed. The suspect is Supervisor Dan White. The reason for all this merriment and he had to pardon the pun is the man standing to my right, the first gay supervisor elected in San Francisco, his name is Harvey Milk. Harvey said that if anyone solved the dog shit problem in the city, that they could be elected mayor. That campaign was anything but normal. Somebody said he's gay. I thought, holy Christ, how are we going to go back to our union and go back to where we were and tell guys that we supported a fruit? You could hear where he was coming from. He was coming from people positions. He wasn't only for gay rights, he was for gay rights because that is a minority. This will be the first time in many years that we've seen so many relatively new faces on the San Francisco board of supervisors. The first Chinese American, Attorney Gordon Lau, the first black woman, Ella Hill Hutch, Harvey Milk, a homosexual, and Dan White, a city fireman who gave up his job to take his seat. What the gay rights ordinance in San Francisco, the main focus is, is to prevent the people who are already employed who are gay, if they want to come out and break down the stereotypes, prevent them from being fired. You can have someone that's a transvestite, a man that for his sexual kicks or orientation, whatever you want to call it, loves to dress up as a woman. If he is a qualified teacher, he can go into any school or he can go into any business and they can't refuse him. And why am I homosexual if I'm affected by role models? I should have been a heterosexual and no offense meant, but if teachers are going to affect you as role models, there'd be a lot of nuns running around the streets today. Harvey Milk.

26614," The President wants to know what's going on. Peter White, a man at the Canadian Treasury Department, calls the NSC asking about this organization Treadstone and his shot. Did you people kill him because he blew your cover? Senator. Or was it Carlos again? I think it was Bourne. Bourne. You're convinced, General Conklin, that Bourne was also responsible for the assassination of Ambassador Leland? I am. Either by himself or working for Carlos. Poppycock. Mr. Abbott. Well, apparently, Senator, we don't have a consensus yet. You're not convinced? I'm not convinced, for one. The facts are as follows. Bourne was in Marseilles shortly before the assassination. That doesn't mean that he did it. He might have gotten witness to be an attempt on the Ambassador's life. He might have been trying to prevent it. And after Marseilles, he vanished and reappeared again in Zurich, where he withdrew several million from the Treadstone account. Then he murdered Chernak, whose workforce forever, kidnapped the Canadian woman and disappeared again. Those are also the facts, Senator. Ambassador Leland and Chernak were both shot in the throat. Is there any significance in that? It's Carlos' signature. Jason Bourne was trying to think to act in a kill like Carlos. He did not kill, Alex. He saved lives while he was undercover. That's true. Taking credit for kills, not killing. Or so he would have us believe. Bourne's mission, Senator, was to get Carlos. Interpol had tried and failed for 20 years. The Israelis tried. Carlos controls an elaborate network of terrorists from who knows from where. We decided we were going to challenge him at his own game. To field our own assassin. Are you serious? The theory was that our man would take credit for kills that were in fact Carlos' kills and invent others. This would enrage Carlos. He'd make a mistake. He'd reveal himself. He's a man of enormous ego. That was the theory. In practice, what happened, in my opinion, is that Jason Bourne turned into exactly what we train him to be. A master assassin. Is that possible in your opinion, David? The evidence against Bourne, it's circumstantial at best. I think he should be eliminated. Alex, please. Well, what we have here is Hugh David and Elliot believing in this man's innocence, General Conklin and Mr. Gillette believing in his guilt. How do we resolve that? What I suggest is that we send him a signal to come in. Now, we'll plant a story about the Canadian woman in the papers. If he does come in, we'll question him. If he doesn't, then we'll know he's turned. Gentlemen. Meg? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27713," Now if I start reading this poem, and I hear this man's voice rising above the sound of my poem, I'm gonna kick his ass right out of this goddamn hall. I don't know if I can make this on just two bottles, it might be a three bottle reading. The creative act is done in that goddamn machine right here. That's where it's done. Dukowski is devoted to the de-dysnification of all of us. Someone has to kick the Mickey Mouse out of our heads. He was appalled by Mickey Mouse. I used to think I was too ugly for women. He was doing what he called research. One night I was in bed with six different women. He said really simply on a percentage basis, I treat men worse every time. It would be nice for me to say, Tim, I'm a tough guy, but I'm not that tough. It was a struggle for him to write it. He beat me and beat me. Remembering certain terrible things. My father was a great literary teacher. He taught me the meaning of pain. Pain without reason. While he was drinking all through the 50s and 60s, he produced more poetry than almost any other person on the planet. A doctor told me, take one more drink and you're dead. See doctors lie to you often. I bought a typewriter and just started typing. Only this time it all came out poetry. There is a loneliness in this world so great that you can see it in the slow movement of the hands of a clock. And I said, how could you write a novel in three or four weeks? And he said, fear. And I was reading the LA Free Press and I just thought this is remarkable. This guy's the writer of the century. A rise in San Francisco for this reading. And my God, it was like the second coming. We didn't have to share the podium. This is a Bacowski event. Do I know you? One more beer, I'll take you all. Forgive me. You have my soul and I have your money. Thank you."

27812," Hi, I'm Alan Arkush and this is Trailers from Hell. What a long, strange trip it's been since the early days of filmed rock concerts. Because we are now in the golden age of rock movie restoration. Using digital tools, lost and unfinished concert films are available with great sound and picture. The Grateful Dead are on screen in a whole new array of film material. I first saw them in June of 1967. I've had a long relationship with the band as a fan and a friend. I cut the trailer for the band's Grateful Dead movie in 1977. But I want to tell you about our two new recent archaeological discoveries. From August 27, 1972, Sunshine Daydream. Ken Kesey and his merry pranksters were going broke running an organic yogurt creamery in Oregon. They needed an influx of cash so they asked their friends the Grateful Dead to come up and play a benefit on a Sunday. A rustic stage was built and in a goat meadow about 20,000 dead heads showed up. The show was recorded and a local documentary crew filmed it with four cameras. No dollies, no cranes, no lights. And as the sun sets the band keeps right on playing and they are basically filmed in the dark. A rough cut was made and then money ran out and was put into a vault for 40 years. But audience tapes were circulated and certain dead heads sang its praises. Two years ago, Rhino Records and the Dead returned to this lost arc of rumored greatness. The film was re-edited and the music remastered and here it is. How good is it? It's amazing. The music is fantastic and what's really cool about this that it's like a message from a lost civilization. It's like a perfect artifact of another time and place. It's as if in the ruins of Pompeii you found a complete work of art that symbolized this civilization. Because on that 100 degree afternoon before a half naked crowd of hippies and a goat pastor, the Grateful Dead played one of the five greatest concerts ever. Trust me, I've seen a lot of dead shows and it's all here. A magical performance, a trip back through time and space. There's even footage of the early acid tests. And while we're tripping back through time and space, let's get on a train across Canada in July of 1970 with the Grateful Dead, the band Delaney and Bonnie, Buddy Guy and the legendary Janis Joplin. On Trailers from Hell, another rock restoration, Festival Express. During the summer of 1970, a unique event took place in the history of rock and roll. A collection of the world's greatest bands boarded a private train for five days. Their plan, to party and jam across Canada. This is the story of Festival Express. That's pretty much the set up for this long lost documentary. What makes this one so special is the behind the scenes filming of all these great musicians hanging out and jamming. The promoter's idea was to treat this mini festival like the circus. After each show, everyone hops on their private train and heads for the next town. Protester showed up at every concert demanding that they should be let in for free. The music belongs to the people, man. Hard to believe that a ticket to this lineup of future rock and roll Hall of Famers was only $17. Back on the train, the bar car was outfitted with amps, instruments and a PA, and that's where all the action happens. But about halfway through the week long trip, disaster strikes. The bar car has run out of liquor. So the train is pulled onto a siding, the hat is passed and the bands buy out all the bourbon scotch and beer in Saskatoon, Canada. Then the party really begins with Janis Joplin as the hostess with the mostest. She leads some great, great drunken jams and the camera puts the viewer on the couch across from these long gone legends. These musicians live to play music and that spirit permeates this charming movie. At the end of the week long tour, they were all genuinely sad to have to part. These two rock movie restorations make for a wonderful journey through the past that we can now visit by just pressing play."

27821," I overheard something today. I think they were talking about assassinating President Sawani. Here at the UN. Secret service. We're with Foreign Dignitary Protection. It's a branch of the United States government. United and the United States. This is international territory. Do you think you could identify the voice you heard if you heard it again? Yes. How did you happen to be up there after hours? I'm an interpreter. I left some of my things in the sound booth. I had to go back for them. And at that moment there happened to be a couple of fellas talking about an assassination in a language that you and maybe eight other people understand. Do you think I'm making it up? What do we make of this interpreter? My opinion? It's a hoax. I'd rather make the mistake of believing her than the bigger one if not. The last thing we can afford is to have some foreign leader get popped on our soil. NSA, CIA, FBI, whatever you need, it's yours. Who was that in the park? It's got nothing to do with you. What are you not telling me? They saw me up there or they could have, I don't know, I'm not sure. Someone tried to run me over this morning, I think. You think? I'm scared and my protector is someone who doesn't believe me. Are we using her as bait? What is she now, a victim or a suspect? I don't know. Is that it? Can you tell me what somebody like you is doing at a rebel rally? The question you should be asking is why would somebody take a picture and type the names of everyone in it on the back? Is it at least? What's going on? She just got on the bus. Get with me here, we got a situation. Get Sylvia Brim off that bus. Right now. What were you doing on that bus? I can't tell you, someone might get hurt. Someone might get hurt? How the hell am I supposed to protect you if I don't know where you are? They're not our family and they're not our friends. You told me that. Are you going to be there until morning? They'll be here. He's here. We're out of time, Tobin.

I love it when I come and visit. Welcome Ma. What do you think? You don't know the whole house. Hello. Ma, this is Giles, my roommate. Giles is an economist. My nephew is a dentist. Can't believe we're doing this. She'll leave in a few days. Bye sweet, bye sweet mother of God. Look how clear your cornea is. Nice bit of improv. Maybe I should just tell her. No, no, she hasn't earned it. I'm in a relationship. We're engaged. She's not Muslim. She's not male either. My life is just a tattered tissue doused into the toilet of life. What will I do now? You could write poetry. I've got champagne trills calling me to Billy's. They've been out whooping it up, the two of them. I like her. She's got an edge. You like her. Yes, well your people do have a fondness for depressing broads. I know about men with men. You do? I subscribe to Rita's Digest. A happy ending justifies everything, Aleem. It's all so confusing. You are bonkers. Nobody will notice. Everybody will notice. I'm so sorry to drag you into this. Oh, it's all right. My fiance's a gay man, I'm not. Just another special moment that makes my life mine. Oh, it's the oldest story in the book. Boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy gets boy. Boy is a man, boy is a man. Boy is a man, boy loses boy, boy gets boy. Boy is a man, boy loses boy, boy gets boy. Boy is a man, boy loses boy, boy gets boy. Boy loses boy and goes to Toronto. Boy gets back together with boy in London for a happy ending. Well, maybe not the oldest story."

27834," All my life, my father was only a photograph in the attic, a dream that had vanished. He left us, twelve years ago. It's always been me, my older brother Andre, and mom, but even without a father, we're still a family. In a million years, I never thought that he'd return. Was it out of love? Or to punish us? Was it to teach us to be men? Or for another reason? Kept secret. We would always ask ourselves, why did he come back? It was strange, being afraid, but also wanting him to love us. Out there on the lake, something happened. Something that would change us forever. Something we would never forget."

27839," We didn't do anything wrong. We did what anyone would do. It's all for Honey. She's not coming back. How do you know that? Have you ever seen something so scary that you just had to show it to someone else? I want to show you something. Police, they found a body. The guy was dead on the living room floor right in front of the TV. The tape. Did you watch it? They keep talking about it. I found you. Her name's Samara. She was murdered, left to die at the bottom of a well. But she didn't die. What's happening? I know this sounds completely crazy. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her. I'm going to go get her.

I know this sounds completely crazy. She wants to be him. Honey, don't you think you should sleep? You have to do it. You have to send it back. Aiden! They stopped me. Open the door honey! Rachel no! Don't let them stop you. Maybe her blood is still moving. I have to show you something. Rachel! Why is she doing this? Aiden! Are you okay? Let me in. Aiden! I'm sorry honey. Rachel, no! Don't let them stop you. I have to show you something. Rachel! Why is she doing this? You! It was you. What did I do? You let the dead get in. Leave him alone! I love you, Mommy. What are you doing?

27846," What is a corporation? It is under the law a legal person. These are special kind of persons who have no moral conscience, designed by law to be concerned only for their stockholders. I just can't be personally responsible. Maybe you better incorporate. There are companies that make our lives better and that's a good thing. The problem comes in the profit motivation. Liz Klaibern jackets, $178 and the workers were paid 74 cents. Nike assigned a time frame, 6.6 minutes to make the shirt. That means the wages come to three tenths of one percent of retail price. Of course they make a profit and it's a good thing. In our search for wealth and for prosperity, we created something that's going to destroy us. I never gave a thought to what we were taking from the earth. I didn't have an environmental vision. In devastation there is opportunity. When the September 11 situation happened, the first thing you thought about was well how much is gold up? You can manipulate consumers. Is it ethical? I don't know. But our role is to move products. It's always going to be there so you may as well have faith in it. There are those who intend that one day everything will be owned by somebody. Within less than ten years a handful of global companies will own directly or through license the actual genes that make up the evolution of our species. I said, you know, this is news.

31770," Well, lackless time was a fact. I was a suspect, got around early enough. For strange reason, I survived that for a while. What finally brought it to a climax was when Zanuck came to me and said, you're never going to work again here. Now I'm going to make an admission. I don't think I've ever told this to anybody. This was a very critical moment when Zanuck put this book in my hand and said, you're leaving, you're getting out of here, you're going to London, you're going to make this because this is going to be probably the last picture you're ever going to make. And get the script out fast. I'd start with the most expensive scenes so that they got the studio on a hook. I began without having read the book and only read it much, much later. Because there was no time for me to get that script going and I was under this pressure. And I think it was Bruce Goldstein who finally found the book and sent it to me. There was a whole other story. Oh, another story. And when I was in London not long ago talking about this film, they said, did you know how angry the author, a man named Gerald Kirsch, was with the film? And I said, well, I'm sure he's right.

32371," Behind this personal column ad that appeared in the Chicago Times, there lies one of the most unusual but factual dramas ever to come to public attention. Because of its impact and great human interest, this story of a brutal killing and unjust conviction was picked up by Time Magazine and Reader's Digest, bringing it worldwide attention. Now, this exciting story, filmed under the title Call Northside 777, comes to the screen, produced by 20th Century Fox. James Stewart, one of the screen's most popular stars, gives his greatest portrayal in Call Northside 777 as McNeil, the reporter who courageously and un-tiringly brings this story to light. I went into this thing believing nothing. I was skeptical. I figured Weecheck is using his mother to spring him. But I've changed my mind. This man is innocent. Richard Conte plays Frank Weecheck, who places his family's happiness above his own freedom. I'll stay here a thousand years. But you must not write anymore. Lee J. Cobb is at his best as the soft-spoken but hard-driving editor. Helen Walker plays McNeil's wife. Kasia Orszaczewski plays Weecheck's mother, the courageous woman who slaved and saved for 11 years to prove her son's innocence. 11 years. I dream and I work. © BF-WATCH TV 2021"

32525," My name is Paul Thomas Anderson. I'm here to talk about the great Max Ophuls. I first came to Max Ophuls. I'm a little bit fuzzy exactly how it happened, but I think I've been watching films that Sam Fuller had done and I was reading that Sam Fuller was so great at these elaborate tracking shots, but really he was nothing compared to the master of the shot. So it led me to find everything I could by Max Ophuls. In terms of the earrings of Madame Deux, this opening shot is clearly from her point of view, but it's also over her shoulder and it doesn't really move on its own accord. It moves with her, it moves with her eyes. I think to look at the actress here, Danielle Derriu, who's in a bunch of his films, I think she was in three or four of his movies, is the perfect reason why I think you can pull off a camera move like this if you have an actor that's in the frame that is capable of doing or is worth watching for that long a period of time. And she certainly is, she's just pretty magnificent. Max Ophuls was really the first person to do with the camera what he did. There's nothing I've seen before these films that compares or comes close, but it's obvious to me now, you know, the stories sunk into my DNA of how to tell a story or what makes an interesting story. It just got in there so strongly. On reflection, I see these movies now and I think, I think, my God, this is probably the first time I was seeing anything like this. And I see things that I have obviously been influenced by or tried to rip off or tried to do, tried to tell a story in such a way. It's amazing how if a film is so good, it just, it gets, it gets under your skin."

I've been involved with these birds for five and a half years now. Whoa! They're wild birds. The only thing that anybody could think of is that they flew off from a ship. A tractor was delivering parrots, head and exit in. There was this crazy woman who had a store and she opened up all the doors and birds flew all out. I saw these wild parrots. They were a big mystery to me and I wanted to find out who they were. I was the only one studying them. I was always worried that people were going to think of me as eccentric. How do you get so attached to an animal? After you leave, what will happen to these birds? I can't take them with me, obviously. So where are you going to go? I have no idea. I'll miss you, Magus. We do a lot of bad things to animals because we don't believe that they feel anything. They're afraid of death, they're afraid of injury, they're afraid of being alone. Like us.

In the hopes of creating a horrible zombie. So he and his horrible zombie dog... ...could go searching for victims in the London fog. His thoughts, though, aren't only of ghoulish crime.

He dug out her grave to make sure she was dead. Unaware that her grave was his mother's flower bed. His mother sent Vincent off to his room. He knew he'd been banished to the Tower of Doom. Where he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life... ...alone with the portrait of his beautiful wife. While alone and insane encased in his doom... ...Vincent's mother burst suddenly into the room. She said, if you want to, you can go out and play. It's sunny outside and a beautiful day. Vincent tried to talk, but he just couldn't speak. The years of isolation had made him quite weak. So he took out some paper and scrawled with it... ...and scrawled with a pen. I am possessed by this house and can never leave it again. His mother said, you're not possessed and you're not almost dead. These games that you play are all in your head.

He saw Abercrombie, his zombie slave... ...and heard his wife call from beyond the grave. She spoke from her coffin and made ghoulish demands... ...while through cracking walls reached skeleton hands. Every horror in his life that had crept through his dreams... ...swept his mad laughter to terrified screams. To escape the madness he reached for the door... ...but fell limp and lifeless down on the floor. His voice was soft and very slow... ...as he quoted the raven from Edgar Allan Poe.

33004," The standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom in the universe is called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And it has this to say about movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give you an idea of the film in question in a very short space of time. Specifically, they begin with the introduction of a main character who will very shortly have something so utterly fantastic happen to him that someone just had to make a movie about him. Often, this section is preceded by the words, in a world, but sometimes not. Trailers also normally employ a deep voice that sounds like a seven foot tall man who has been smoking cigarettes since childhood. The goal is to create a piece of advertising that's original and exciting, yet intelligent and provocative. In other words, lots of things blowing up. Occasionally interrupted by a girl in a bikini. That does absolutely nothing for me. Generally, trailers also feature heartless evil villains, hideous creatures, dolphins, physical violence, and of course, the promise of true love. For heaven's sake. And lastly, there is a final montage, often set to rock music. That is designed simply to blow away whatever sinuses you have left in your brain. This culminates in a reveal of the main title, like so. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Followed by the release date. So that the audience might plan the next few months of their lives accordingly. Thanks for watching."

Is Rose here? I want you out now. Where am I supposed to go? You figure it out. Is this Ella Hersh? Yes, it is. Did you have a daughter named Caroline? This is my granddaughter Maggie Feller. Hello. Turns out I have a grandmother I never knew about. Our mother was dad, a grandmother might have come in handy. She was impossible, Rose. We know all about you. You must come to Florida to milk your grandmother for all she's worth. Does this place have a pool? This place just keeps getting better and better. How come you don't have any pictures of my mom around? You put out pictures, people ask questions. They expect you to tell them everything. I don't do that. What was she like as a daughter? Loving her in the right way was difficult. I didn't know there was a right way and a wrong way. What are you doing here? We're moving her in an old folks home. It's a retirement community for active seniors. I always envied you girls. You had a bond that I've never had with anyone. Chewing gum? No one will notice. Right, hi. I can talk because I have a mouth. My heel has a mouth. In her shoes. We're a pair. Except in share. They split up. They remain quite close."
38886," If you can, try and hit it at your mother's backhand. It's pretty weak. Yes! Ow! Joan, I'm sorry! Okay. Your mom and I, we're going to separate. I've got you Tuesday, Wednesday, and every other Thursday. What about the cat? The cat? We didn't discuss the cat. I've got an elegant new house across the park. It's an elegant block, the fillet of the neighborhood. There's a desk for you to do your homework. Dad, this is for our lefty. I've come by to tell you I'm not staying here anymore. Why? Because you cheated on Dad. Your father told you. Under our noses, like a brothel, men coming in and out. You sound like your father. I've never had an affair with a student, though many have come on to me. That's why you might not want to be attached to you, Abe. When am I going to meet Sophie? She's not gorgeous, but she's cute. Do you like Sophie? She's not the type I go for. Lily is pretty. Hmm. All that work I did at the end of our marriage, making dinners, cleaning up, being more attentive, it never was going to make a difference. You never made a dinner. I made burgers the time you had pneumonia. Burgers."
38992," your business. Hello. Congratulations you went nine and two last Sunday. This is Walter Abrams. I run the biggest sports service in the country. This is a joke right? No joke. I want you to come to New York and work for me. Whoa! The Marlboro man here. Hey Lee, that's me 30 years ago right? He's a little taller. I'll give him that. We'll build an empire around you. We're gonna start by giving you a new name, John Anthony. The million dollar man. Listen to what he's asking you. I'm in. If you do this, there's no going back. You understand what I'm saying? John Anthony here ready to make all your betting dreams come true. John Anthony huh? All's I see is another wannabe in a thousand dollar suit. Where did the wise keep the suit you came in with? All right Jethro. This guy is a machine. All he does is workout and pick winners. Ten in two, 85% weekend. You're a mutant. Winning is one of those rare commodities on earth that money cannot buy until you called me. Do you like Monday night? I don't know. Pick one. There's like a million dollars riding on that game. Oh there's like a whole lot more than that. You go two for 12 on our highest volume weekend ever and what's left to say? I lost 380,000. I had a life. I built an empire around him. I'm finished. You have to get out. He will ride you into the ground. I gotta go back to being me. You made a career choice buddy. You've lost it. I'm not asking you if I can leave Walter. I'm telling you it's over. If you want something from me you're gonna have to rip it out of my talons. You feel that? You feel that? You feel that? Two for the money. This is dangerous territory."
38994," No life is perfect. You are sweet. Though it may seem to be. Secrets and discontent lie hidden beneath the smoothest surface. Who's that? Mr. Buell. In this, as in so many things, my life was no exception. There's been an accident. Someone hurt? Killed, I'm afraid. The husband of our cleaner. Have they any idea who did it? I saw it. You saw it? Did you know that Mrs. Pierce has a criminal record? We've all got stuff in our past that wasn't too clever. I know what you've done. What? You feel it's cheating to keep quiet, hmm? Here am I thinking we are very happy. Only to discover that on the contrary we, or at any rate you, are very unhappy. What's that? It's what? There's a scratch. I might have scraped a gate or something. He can't have had anything to do with Mr. Pierce's death. He says you rang him at about quarter past six that night. You see my difficulty, sir. I don't think I can stand this much longer. Am I missing something? Whatever I do, I always feel that I am disappointing you. I do care about you. Some people are wreckers. We're all wreckers. We make choices, but we don't see the damage we cause. I fail every test you set me, but you keep setting them. Why? I don't know. I don't know."

Ehdottomanne toimin täällä ensimmäisen direktiivin vastaista. Me varmistetaan P-liiton syntyminen. Keinoilla millä hyvänsä. Vallanpitäjät ovat voimattomia tulevaisuuden teknologian edessä. Ja uusi maailman järjestys astuu voimaan. Taktisesta puuttuu edelleen tuoli! Tehotaso 96,3 prosenttia. Täyskijarautuminen! Nyt! Edessä on uskalias matka. Otaksun, että olemme tulleet jonkinlaiseen oman maailmamme peiliin ulottuvuuteen. Täällä kapteeni Sherry Pai, Babel 13. Täällä keisari Perk, P-Liton ylijohtaja. Voisitte vaikka tuoda miehistönne lomailemaan hetkeksi. Mutta keisarilla on muuta mielessä. Muinaiset ennustukset käyvät totean. Suuri pimeys tulee. Ja me kaikki kuolemme. Kun rauhan keinot on käytetty. Maan sotalain pykälän 42 perusteella tuomitsen teidät kuolemaan rikoksistaan ja ihmiskuntaa vastaan. On aika lämmittää tuikkupankit.

39231," I understand you have to let me go. You're about to lose this company. Nine hundred and seventy-two million dollars. I cry a lot lately. Drew, I have some really bad news. Dad died. I'll be back in two days. Just get dad home. The two sides of this family have never integrated well, so don't expect to make a lot of friends when you go back. Drew doesn't make friends, Mom. I have friends. Louisville, Kentucky, huh? Actually near Louisville. Louisville. Louisville. I'll keep that in mind. Home business or family? My dad. He's okay, right? He's fine. They're all here, cuz. This loss will be met by a hurricane of love. You look just like your daddy. We hope you're gonna stay for a while. Uncle Mitch always wanted us to meet. Everybody says we look alike. Weird, huh? It's like looking in a mirror. Hello? Hello, stranger. I wanted to tell you the truth. My dad's dead. They're not buying cremation. Was there such a thing as partial cremation? How can you even say such a thing? Good Lord. Things really are black and white. Every day needs a purpose. I can't believe I'm telling this to someone. Sometimes the end of one man's journey. You and your dad were close. Oh, very close. I knew him very, very well. Very, very well. Yeah, I don't know my father very well either. Is the beginning of another man's life. We should have taken this trip years ago. This is for you. I love you. What you're seeing is not really me. The real me is a spectacular failure. You're always trying to break up with me. And we're not even together. We're not. Please don't take this as rejection. I really don't. I'm learning to fly."
39234," I'm back living with my folks. Only now I got two more mouths to feed. The mind's hiring, you know. Wouldn't you like to make the same kind of money your dad does? The mind pays six times what I'm making now. You want to be a lesbian now? I want to be a lesbian. Okay now, what are you? A cowboy or a cowgirl? I'm a cowgirl. No, not up there you're not. You must be Hank's daughter. Doc says you look darn good under those clothes. Sense of humor ladies, Rulo numero uno. I know things have been hard, but they're going to change. I knew you were going to cry. Can you find your mouth? Meet Bobby Sharp. He runs a powder room with a short one body. And we want a nice body, no fatties. You're taking jobs where there aren't any to take. These boys aren't your friends. Sherry! No, get off! Stop fighting! I think we should go to Pearson. Tell them what's going on. This is our lives you're screwing with. The same has a problem and we're going to solve it. Thank you, Mr. Pearson. We're willing to allow you to tender your resignation effective immediately. I work damn hard every day same as you. No, you're the same as me. No, there's a few differences. You don't go to work scared of what they're going to write about you on the walls or what kind of disgusting thing you might find in your locker. Keep your mouth shut. Don't take it like a man. He attacked me. Bob, you lay hand on her? The answer's no. I want us to the mine, the company, all of them. You can't win. None of those women will take your side. Whether you win or lose, you stand up. Suddenly I found that I'd lost my way in this city. Some things are for men and some things are for women. If she wins, this will affect every company in America. What are you supposed to do? I'm the ones with all the power. We're hurting those who love. You stand up for your friends. You stand up and tell the truth. The heck of a thing. Watch one year old get treated that way. She's still my daughter, isn't she? I don't want to shut down the mine. I just want to go to work like everyone else."
39292," Let me see this. It's a loyalty offer to America. Are you now or have you ever been? There was a joke at first. Miro signed it. Mom signed it? If you don't sign this, are you and I a target? If I don't sign it, they'll fire me. Ten seconds. Ready on camera. Good evening. Any man who protects communists will be a target. You can't convict people by rumor and hearsay in your area. Are my children going to be asked who denounced me? Are they going to be judged on what their father was labeled? I see a chain reaction that has no end. Charges were in a sealed envelope. Nobody saw them. Wouldn't you guess that the people who have seen the contents of that envelope might have a better idea of what makes them a target? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Who? Who are these people, sir? Who are the people? Are they elected? Are they appointed? Is it you? I've searched my conscience and I can't find any justification for this. Our next show is going to be about Senator McCarthy. We're going to go right at him. We will not walk in fear one of another. This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent. Mr. Edward R. Murrow has made repeated attacks upon me and those fighting communists. Somebody's going to go down. You're going to get out of this year. Not me, you. McCarthy wants April 6th. I will not be deterred. He's going to come after me. Do you understand the position you're putting us in? Let's walk very carefully through these next few moments. Why don't you just fire me now? Go after Joe Kennedy. We'll pay for it. Murrow is a symbol, the leader, and the cleverest of the jackal pack. Engaged in propaganda for communist cause. Okay, fellas, here we go. You might as well go down swinging. We're going to go with the story because the terror is right here in this room. Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two. We cannot defend freedom abroad by discerning it at home. Good night and good luck."
39381," Do I need to introduce myself? I've kept company with bad men on my life. I wish to present you with a proposition. I suppose I told you there was a way to save your little brother Mikey from the noose. Suppose I gave you a horse, a gun. So what is it that you want? I know where your brother Arthur Burns is. It is a godforsaken place. You want me to kill me, brother? I want you to kill your brother. Word has it you promised those animals who raped Eliza Hopkins a pardon if Charlie Burns brought back his brother. Arthur Burns is a monster, an abomination. It is he who is responsible for this outrage. Your brother's come to kill you. I can help him. You can help me. Is everything all right? Perhaps you better ask your husband. I will civilise this land. Who do you think you are? The judge and the jury? Arthur Burns must be stopped. My god, man, they raped him. She was my friend! You should never have left us. Brother. Hang on Mikey come Christmas Day. One! I know where you've come back Charlie. May the Lord make us truly thankful for what we are about to receive. If you have to kill one, make sure you bloody will kill them all. When said the mountain of the stars in the sky, said the wind that followed him home. Love. Love is the key. Love and family. Love."
39398," At long last, the movie you've been waiting for. A thrilling look at the history of our great nation. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the Confederate States of America. Learn how we protected the noble institution of slavery. A new generation of young people are excited now about owning Negroes. Watch subjugation at its finest and the master race rise to unprecedented heights. So, let's start with Jupiter and his family. Versatility is the key with Jupiter. He's healthy, well-mannered, loyal, smart, but not uppity. Oh, and what a litter of pick and any she's had, as with all SSN products. We can either break up Jupiter's family for you, or you can have them as a set. So, let the bidding begin. A quick trial was convened, and former President Lincoln was convicted of war crimes against the Southern nation. Now I, too, am a Negro. I am a Negro. Introducing the Shackle, the revolutionary new way of servant monitoring. The Shackle will stand up to the most strenuous of escape attempts, perfect for children, and at the low, low price of $49.95. Hitler proposed that America join with him in a final solution. But he did create a provision allowing a small number of Jews to remain on the reservation. You're on Long Island. Slavery, like nothing else, is what defines us, as a people, as a nation. Amen. You"

My job here is to mold each and every one of you into upstanding citizens. Young man, that just earns you a suspension. It's within my authority to suspend you for such a reckless act. This is a high school. What is your film about? George Michael's Fall From Grace. Are you retarded? Really. She's like the worst principal ever. Suspension for the performance of an art piece. I've seen better acting in porn. Suspension for writing poetry in a personal journal. Whoever wrote this should be expelled. It's improper. Now, if you really love and care about education, take a look around this school. Forget the suspension. You're expelled. If these kids want an education... You just have to be more creative. I got it. They're gonna have to teach their school... You sure you can do this? A lesson. Watch me work. Now! We invite you to join us in the fight against this administration. This cheer sucks. We need to do something edgier. That was so hot. If your principal calls me, I may have to tell her to kiss Mike. Support your classmates. She can't suspend all of us. Shut that down! Shut the whole building down if you have to. Now! Go defense! No justice! No peace! I'm not speaking English. This is racism. You want spring roll? You ordered a pizza with your one phone call."

Oh, look, she's drunk again. You know, Harry, I have to say, I know what you're saying. I feel the void. What are you talking about? Since when do you feel the void? I've felt it for a while now. I just think we all focus on the wrong things, like clothes, money, diets, stupid crap. And you think about our grandparents, and they went through two wars and a depression. They had to think about where was their next meal coming from, and could they afford to keep the apartment heated? And who was going to pay for the doctor when someone got sick? They were miserable. Well, they had a reason to be, whereas we, on the other hand, don't. I totally agree with you, Annie. You're so full of shit. His parents grew up on Park Avenue.

He was thin as a rail, losing weight. He was completely delusional. He was hospitalized almost immediately. He was obsessed with the devil and Satan. He became so obsessed that it was all he could talk about. This is Daniel Johnson speaking from a mental hospital. They tell me I'm crazy here. Out come the demons. Yeah!

Ten years later, these futuristic cars were almost entirely gone. What happened? Why should we be haunted by the ghost of the electric car? The exciting thing about this is the cost of operating the car is the same as if you were driving a typical gasoline car, but the gasoline only costs 60 cents a gallon. I plug it in at night and when I need to drive it, I unplug, drive it away. Believe it or not, that sucker goes. That thing will take you so fast you could get a ticket.

There's still roughly a trillion barrels worth of oil in the Earth's crust. That's a hundred trillion dollars worth of business yet to be done. General Motors made a commitment to the Hummer because they could see the Hummer would make them money. The electric vehicle is not for everybody. It can only meet the needs of 90% of the population. We're up against the automobile industry, the oil industry. It's David versus Goliath. Who killed the electric car? Lack of corporate wisdom. In my opinion, it's big oil. The murder was committed by the General Motors company. What's interesting, you're going to be shredding some new cars. Why are you shredding them up? A little bit of a mystery, really. That seems like a shame. I think it will go down as one of the biggest blunders in the history of the automotive industry."

When I first heard the term heavy metal, I didn't have the faintest idea what they were talking about. What? What's that? It's a substrata of society and the fact that the outside world doesn't understand is fantastic. Metal fans love it forever. Like no one goes, yeah I was really big into Slayer one summer. Ms. Gore was looking for sadomasochism and bondage and she found it. Someone looking for surgical references would have found it as well.

47330," Hi, this is David Dacoto and I'm at the Trailers from Hell Studios in Hollywood, California. Back in the 1970s, it seemed like every weekend a car chase movie came out, but you better fasten your seatbelts with this one. It's Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry. Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry came out in 1974, but I saw it when it was re-released with Vanishing Point. I got to see two movies for the price of one, two amazing car chase movies. Love them both, but Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry is a classic. Can you believe that director John Huff directed The Legend of Hell House and Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry the same year? One of the first producers I met in Los Angeles when I moved here was Norman T. Herman. He finished a run at AIP and left with James Nicholson to go over to 20th Century Fox to make a series of independent films for them under his own label. I asked him about Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry. He had lots of stories, lots of anecdotes about it, but he also said it was one of the toughest productions he'd ever worked on. He had mentioned that the ending of this movie, which is kind of a jaw dropper, took an entire day to prepare and then they didn't get the shot at the end of the day. It was the first time in his career where an entire day the cameras did not roll and he was really upset. They restaged it for the next day and they got the shot. It's incredible. John Huff brought in Susan George from England to play Dirty Mary and Peter Fonda was assigned by 20th Century Fox to play Crazy Larry. But one of the real stars of this movie was James Gavin, an actor helicopter pilot who performed some of the most hair-raising helicopter stunts I've ever seen in a movie. Vic Morrow is amazing in this as well as Adam Rourke and believe it or not the thing is Ken Tobey is in there someplace. This is a favorite movie of Quentin Tarantino's.

47493," I'm Paul Whiteman and this is Trailers from Hell. In the early 40s one of the biggest hits on Broadway was an all-african-american musical called Cabot in the Sky, made a big star out of Ethel Waters and a hit song out of Happiness is a Guy Named Joe, which later won the best song Oscar. Anyway in 1943 MGM after great debate decided to make a musical of it. There was great debate because who would go see a movie starring all black people they wondered. In fact it was not shown in many states in the South. They were pretty brave to do this. The fabulous Lena Horne has a number in it in a bathtub that was considered too racy for a black woman to do. It was cut out of the picture although you can see it in one of the VATS entertainment movies. It's well worth seeing. I want you to take a look at the beginning of this trailer and tell me what hint you get that Negroes are involved in this picture. This is Vincent Minnelli's first big movie. He had been a production designer and they gave him his break to direct this the big-time musical extravaganza that had the big-town cheering month after month. This is actually a wonderful movie. Ethel Waters got to be in the movie which is unusual. They replaced the Broadway lead with Eddie Rochester Anderson who had become a huge celebrity on the Jack Benny radio program. This picture has the fabulous Lena Horne, Duke Ellington and his band and so many of the leading black performers. Louis Armstrong, Mantan Moreland, Willie Best, Butterfly McQueen. It's a delicious movie with great music. Costumes by Irene. It's really an MGM class production. It's another retelling of Faust with Rex Ingram. He played the genie in Thief of Baghdad. In this one he's Lucifer. He also played the Lord in the green pastures. Triple threat. Anyway this is a terrific movie and well worth seeing. The two black musicals that were made by Hollywood, this one by MGM and Stormy Weather, I think by Fox later, are both well worth watching because the talent on screen is incredible. These people are just so gifted. you"

She was the people's princess. No member of the royal family will speak publicly about this. Diana is no longer a member of the royal family. What are you talking about? Charles, this is a private matter. We do things in this country quietly with dignity. Will someone please save these people from themselves?

You can imagine I'm going to drop everything and come down to London before I attend to my grandchildren. Then you're mistaken. Try and see it from her perspective. She's been brought up to believe it's God's will. She is who she is. I think we should leave God out of it. What would you suggest? Prime Minister, some kind of a statement. The moment for statements has passed. Are you alright? Something's happened. There's been a change, some shift in values. Maybe he's got a point. What if my actions are damaging the crowd? I prefer to keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly I believe that was what the people wanted from their Queen.

47721," What does it take to entertain a child? It doesn't take 3D or CGI or talking animals or pop songs or celebrity voiceovers. Children's pleasures are much simpler. In The Red Balloon, a 34-minute long film directed by Albert Lamouris is a masterpiece of simplicity. It has one basic special effect. It moves gracefully and deliberately through the gorgeous streets of Paris. And it has only two characters, a boy and his balloon. Perhaps the most accurate way to describe this movie is as a love story. The boy and the balloon meet each other one day on the Paris streets and you see how their bond forms, even as you also see some of the forces that threaten to drive them apart. You also witness how this child, how this boy forms an attachment with an inanimate object that is as intimate and as real and exquisite as anything else. The Red Balloon is a wonderful movie for children. It's also a uniquely insightful movie about childhood. And in the more than 50 years since it was first made, and in however long it's been since you saw it last, I guarantee it's none of its magic."

Would you like some of these? What are they? I just got some samples in the mail, so I don't know. Words cannot describe these people. Just a little kibble. It's for dogs.

48698," Today, two American women came to the Vatican hoping to deliver a letter to the new pope. I'm going to put it in direct language so they'll understand. The guards wouldn't let them in. His name is Father O'Grady. He was the closest thing to God that we knew. This is going to be the most honest confession of my life. My last memory of Father is severe pain before I black out. Do you feel aroused when you see children in underwear? I say, yeah. How about children who are naked? I say, yeah. He had sexual urges towards a nine-year-old. Is that cause to remove him from ministry? No. Mahoney said, I knew that you were being abused, but you were a girl. My hand went down and I brought up her night dress. Had you been a boy, that would have been obscene. One of the aspects of being successful in the church is that you create a good image. The thing he had to do then to avoid scandal was to move O'Grady to an outlining parish. I was a danger to them, but I would have been a danger to others as well. And I have to ask, did he ever touch you when you were a little girl? He just said yes. And the whole world collapsed. They knew children were being victimized and they did nothing except ensure that law enforcement would not find out. They squelched the report and they carried on as normal. Do you think that somebody should have told the cops that O'Grady had been previously accused? Repeat that please. He has so many victims, I don't think he can keep track. I think it's in the hundreds. I am battling to regain my life back. I've encountered deception, perjury, denial and deceit at the highest levels of the Catholic Church. Do you think if a child were raped, that would be something that you would forget? I would have instructed the witness not to answer."

48741," You say you've been in trouble all your life. Why is that? I'm just one of those faces, you know, people never like me face. If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moments. You have to be more politically aware in a day and age like this. It's impossible to close your eyes to it. As South Vietnamese forces become stronger, the rate of American withdrawal can become greater. Peace in your mind, peace in the world.

We came here to say to all of you, apathy isn't it? And that we can do something. His activities were being monitored. I was followed in the car and my phone was tapped. I think they wanted me to know to scare me and I was scared, paranoid. The Immigration and Naturalization Service began deportation proceedings. Will you stop speaking out against the war? No, nothing will stop me, I'll always say what I feel. Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives that are liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. Their distortion of the Constitution was the greatest disloyalty to this country. Lenin represented life and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Bush represent death. His message is still alive. Our job now is to tell them that there is still hope. We must get them excited about what we can do again. The U.S. versus John Lenin."

His phenomenal sense of smell was a gift that had been given to him and him alone. Master can I come to work for you? My nose knows all the smells in the world. No man can call himself a perfumer unless he has proved his worth. The soul of beings is their scent.

I'm creating a perfume. Each perfume contains three chords, twelve notes in all. There's a murderer out there.

I'm not sure about this. If marrying you tonight keeps you from going to Vietnam, then it's worth it. What if Kennedy loses? We can all forget it, man. I'm 19, Jimmy. I don't want to go to Vietnam. Do you? Now that Dr. King is gone, no one left but Bobby. No one. The next president of the United States, Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Our lives on this planet are too short.

49651," This is Alan Spencer for Trailers from Hell. The story of Sylvester Stallone and Rocky Balboa follow a similar kind of trajectory. Unknown, given a shot at superstardom and then he becomes a superstar and then he ascends to the very top and has to kind of defend himself against competitors and you know experiences the various peaks and valleys of fame and then comes back down to earth. The question is, is you know Sylvester Stallone is also a writer so could he reconnect with the original intent of his pugilist character as well as reconnect with a modern audience? The answer exists in this movie. Put a hint about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit. When I saw this trailer in the theater some people applauded but many laughed and groaned. Not surprising considering all the jeers this project got when it was announced. Late night comedians called it on golden gloves and made metamucil jokes. The New York Post proclaimed it Stallone's final embarrassment. By the way, I was one of the people clapping. Stallone had trouble getting this project going. On the Howard Stern show he described producers taking meetings with him out of courtesy but showing no interest in making the movie since the Rocky series had seemingly run its course. Stallone briefly had a men's magazine called Sly and published excerpts from the script. Self-publishing seemed to imply defeat. Stallone certainly grounded this tale with verisimilitude. Balboa is retired, a widower running a restaurant, which is believable, and the dearth of decent adversaries in the heavyweight divisions makes pulling out an old marquee name seem almost credible. Stallone knows his sports. Rocky agrees to fight a current champion in an exhibition match for charity so this isn't about winning but once again going the distance. He's an underdog again. The promoters in the story hedged their bet and so did the studio. Like the first film, the movie was given a modest budget, 24 million. I'd read one of the key reasons the film was green lit was because if even if it were deemed unreleasable it would add bonus value to the Rocky DVD sets. Needless to say the film was a hit. The other sequels to Rocky were about defending his title but here he's fighting for his dignity. Having lost his wife and trying to connect again with his conflicted son, the inspiring speech he delivers to his son is some of the best writing Stallone has ever done. And when the Rocky fanfare blaze were treated to another montage training sequence, the audience roared with approval, cheered all the way until the ending credits. The New York Post, which had predicted this would be an embarrassment, suddenly ran a headline declaring one word, knockout. Guess they suffered some memory loss. After Rocky Balboa was a success Stallone revived Rambo, then went on to prove he wasn't expendable. He's also slayed to pay the character of Rocky again in a film about the grandson of Apollo Creed and there's a musical version of Rocky coming out soon. It ain't over till it's over."

The human drama which preceded this incredible raid... Reveals the inspiration and obsession of one man with an idea. But, sorry, they must realize if we can burst those dams and flood the Ruhr Valley... They can save the thousands of bombs that they're dropping on the factories there. I can only pass on to you the decisions of the Ministry, Mr. Wallace. Of course, it might help if you could get the support of somebody with personal influence. Won't you suggest?

50641," Hi, I'm Marshall Harvey and welcome to Trailers from Hell. Now a few years ago, some of my film geek buddies and I got together, we decided to have our own mini film festival. We each had to pick the most bizarre movie that we had ever seen. Now I've seen some pretty strange films in my time, but my choice just had to be Nobuhiko Obyashi's surrealistic cult horror film from 1977 called House. This movie was a surprise box office hit in Japan, much to the chagrin of its Toho producers. It wasn't released in America until 2010. The plot concerns a young schoolgirl named Gorgeous who invites six girlfriends to visit her aunt's home in the country. What they don't know is the house is haunted and Auntie is an evil spirit. Obyashi, who mostly directed television commercials, was a child survivor of Hiroshima. He gives the aunt a backstory about her tragic loss of a loved one in World War II. I guess that explains why she's an evil spirit. He uses every pre-CGI cinematic technique in his arsenal, including flash cuts, cheesy optical effects, mant paintings, and stop motion animation. A lot of the ideas in this twisted fairy tale were suggested by his pre-teen daughter, giving the movie the logic of a child's nightmare. And this movie has everything, disembodied heads that bite rear ends, silly slapstick, weird Japanese ghosts, a possessed white cat, rooms that fill with blood, a good deal of nudity and gore, and even a human-eating piano. It's all way over the top nonsense, but well worth a visit."

50851," It was always somebody that did something wrong, whether they did or not, there was a reason for her to have a problem. I was called that afternoon to her house. She said, I notified him that we have war, that he's no longer my friend, he's my enemy. So from this point on, if you see him, shoot him. Rivy and his people were deployed in this area. But it wasn't going to be easy, because he's good. We made a mistake. We won't get him or we're going to get killed by this guy here. Rivy, a driver, and a second gunman were in a white van. I was going to be the shooter, so I got out of M16 and I just told the driver, when you get near him, window to window, let me know, and I fired to the door. Because I knew if I opened the door, when we were moving, he was going to know. He knew all the tricks. Chucho opened up the garage door, drove out of his garage onto 168th Street, and then drove west towards US 1. US 1, where the light was, it was about half a mile away. So we had plenty of time. Somewhere in this area would have been where they would have caught up with Chucho. We were in parallel with him, both westbound, mantle left, Chucho to the right. And I grabbed the machine gun and I started shooting his star, right before he started shooting his star. He lost control of the car one time. He almost hit a wall, but he took control and he came back on the road this time. It was about that time we were approaching US 1. By that time, we were real close to the red line. There was a gas station on the right-hand side. As they approach US 1, Chucho then cuts through this gas station parking lot in a real high rate of speed, goes north on US 1, and that's when he loses the guy shooting at him. I looked everywhere and I didn't see him. So we just left. We said, you know, fucked it up."

Now girls, be honest, are these pants too tight? I'll do it. It doesn't have to be perfect, just spit it out. I really wanted to talk to you about a fact that unfortunately we're gonna have to leave early to finish the last verse of this song. A melody is like sex. I so get that.

Hugh Grant. Grin? Grin again? There is a little something. No, there's a lot of something. Drew Barrymore. Best time I've had in the last 15 years was sitting at that piano with you. It's wonderfully sensitive. Especially from a man who wears such tight pants. It forces all the blood to my heart. I've been sleeping with a clown above me. I'm a clown. I'm a clown.

There are no other women in Hampshire! May I introduce Mr. Thomas Lerfroy? What do you make of Mr. Lerfroy? We are honoured by his presence. If you wish to practice the art of fiction, to be the equal of a masculine author, your horizons must be widened. Lerfroy does have a reputation. Presumably as the most disagreeable, Miss! insolent, arrogant, impertinent of men. Jane! What is she doing? Writing. Can anything be done about it? My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen! Miramax Films invites you. A novel must show how the world truly is, somehow reveal the true source of our actions. To discover the inspiration behind Jane Austen's greatest love stories. A young woman of family? Yes, Uncle. I wish to introduce her to your affections discreetly. This is an outrage! I will not accept this. How can you of all people dispose of yourself with that affection? How can I dispose of myself with it? I have a wife with a literary reputation. Nothing short of scandalous.

Obviously you're dealing with some inconsistencies. I wake up every morning to find my husband has died again. I think that goes just a little beyond inconsistent. How do you know my husband? Just thought that after we talked and we talked. We were here yesterday. I've never met you before in my life. The husband was in a fatal car crash on Wednesday. That's strange. He showed up in my office on Tuesday claiming he was already dead. You said he was gonna die before the accident? Yeah. Oh, God. Jim, don't go on this trip, please. What? What is it? Excuse me. I'm Claire Francis. It's nice to meet you. Yeah. Something bad is gonna happen. It's never too late to fight for what's important in your life. But I don't know what to fight for. Sandra Bullock.

52245," People ask me if Steven Spielberg, when we did Blazoglory at DreamWorks, gets involved. And so we had tracked the movie like a classic sports drama, basically also, because that was one task we kind of gave ourselves. Stuart Kornfeld, another alumni and myself, that the movie had to work if you took all the comedy away, it still had to work as a skating movie, a sports movie where you really care, you know, and we're invested in the characters winning or making it. And then we did get one memo from him saying, you have to come up with something in the third act that trumps all the other physical deeds in the movie. Set pieces or the audience will be disappointed. It doesn't matter what genre it is. And that's when we came up with the North Korean death-defying skating feat that had only been tried once and it ended with the skater's head being cut off. And that was really half the people I've ever talked to who loved the movie's favorite thing in the whole movie. So, you know, he was absolutely right."

54426," I think there is no present without the past, nor future without the present. Therefore, the more the past is clear, the clearer the present and the future will be. A revolution is a moment of passion and energy and hope that very quickly fades into history. So how do we remember those times when everything changed? 1208 East of Bucharest poses this question in two different ways. It asks what is the proper way to commemorate the Romanian revolution of 1989? And second, can we be sure that that revolution really happened? The movie was written and directed by Corneliu Poramboiu, who was a teenager when Nicolae Ceaucescu was overthrown. And Poramboiu is part of a new wave of Romanian filmmakers who are committed, above all, to honesty. This is in sharp contrast to the characters in 1208, who are characterized by vanity, duplicity and sloth. Some of the very characteristics that the revolution was supposed to erase. There's a self-important and pompous television personality, a debt-rich, a very rich personality. There's a self-important and pompous television personality, a debt-ridden, alcoholic school teacher and a semi-retired Santa Claus. Are these the heroes of the revolution? They seem to think so, or maybe they don't. But in any case, they have to do something to commemorate that event, and so they gather in a drab television studio in the provincial town of Vaslui in Transylvania, where they happen to be the director, Corneliu Poramboiu's actual hometown. A few people call in to make comments and to challenge their account of the events of December 1989, but none of it seems to matter, and really, nobody seems to care. The film all takes place in a single day. The first part of it follows these three guys through the routines of their daily life. The second half is devoted to their broadcast. Now that part of the movie mimics the almost amateurish techniques of low-budget, local television production. But what distinguishes both that part and the rest of the movie is a sly, deadpan, understated wit, and also a very deliberate, which is to say, a very slow, sense of pace. Poramboiu is partly exploring the discrepancy between the possibly mythic memories of grand historical events and the more compromised, confused reality of their actual occurrence. The title of this film, in Romanian, asks the question, did the revolution happen or didn't it? And the movie provides a cogent answer. Maybe."

55071," We will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom. When we were first starting the reconstruction, there were 500 ways to do it wrong and two or three ways to do it right. What we didn't understand is that we were going to go through all 500. I was chairman of the National Intelligence Council. I was the director of strategic policy. Rumsfeld called me and handled humanitarian affairs, reconstruction. I had been to Iraq eight times. I knew what the facts on the ground were. I had no personnel. We had no phones for a while. I don't think we can do this. The president had already made a different decision. There are volumes on how we should do this. Almost none of this was integrated into the Pentagon's thinking. We watched our careful planning essentially discarded. There wasn't enough time, but maybe for the next war. The Americans were not acting as the police. They didn't know the streets of Baghdad. They didn't speak the language. It was a free for all. There was absolute lawlessness. We're in a transition period. Stuff happens. The Iraqi army was essentially standing there waiting. The Iraqi army has been disbanded and I was floored. You had huge ammunition dumps that weren't guarded. I'm standing there watching these insurgents pull out rockets and mortars and bombs and the US. We just don't have enough people to cover it. We never had a single armored Humvee while we were in Iraq. Why don't we have those resources? You go to war with the army you have. We don't have enough troops. They'll be back there for their fifth, sixth and seventh tours of duty. Last contract I ever signed with the government. Produced a first national estimate on the state of the insurgency. The president called it guesswork. I haven't read it. Life could be lousy. Life could be okay. Life could be better. If democracy cannot provide for the Iraqi people, people will say to help is democracy we need strong men. There are nights when I don't sleep very well. I just can't hold my peace any longer."
55078," In this place of calm and beauty, of deep and primitive emotions, the woman Bathsheba Everdeen lived. And here she gave herself to three men, far from the madding crowd. Thomas Harvey's greatest of all love stories comes to the screen, starring Julie Christie as the bold, beautiful adventurist. With Peter Finch as William Boldwood. Miss Everdeen, I've come to make you my offer of marriage. I do not love you, Mr. Boldwood. Certainly I must say that. Say at least that you do not refuse me, absolutely. While one pledged his love, another promised only passion. Terence Stamp as the quicksilver soldier of fortune, Sergeant Troy. Even with a woman, he knows but one way. Conquest. And Alan Bates as Gabriel Oak, a man of many strengths and one compelling weakness. And where in particular lies my unworthiness in not marrying you, perhaps? My opinion is that you are greatly to blame for playing pranks on a man like Mr. Boldwood. Leading a man on you don't care for just for the fun of it, just to satisfy your own vanity. Dare you criticize my personal conduct? Well, you invited it. I won't allow any man in my employ to criticize me. Three men and a woman that none of them can possess completely. Pashava, I come here for you. Come, madam. Do you hear me? Come. Here is all the power, the scope, the splendor, and the spectacle of exploding passions. Julie Christie as Bathsheba. Terence Stamp. Peter Finch. Alan Bates. A story of all the things that we call love, far from the madding crowd."
55094," I'm scared. Something happened, Dad. Something bad. Hello? Sir, I'm calling about your son. My son's in Iraq. Your son was in Iraq, sir. His unit arrived stateside four days ago. Anything you want to tell me? Why can't I go with you? He's holed up someplace celebrating the last thing he needs is his mother walking in on him. I don't want to seem like I'm not concerned, but I expect your son will come stumbling in anytime. Sir, I regret to inform you that a body was found last night. I need to see where he died. There's nothing to see. The murder was committed in arduous death. That's where it gets murky. Wrap it up, fellas! Boys with the shiny buttons are coming in! If your crime scene boys knew what they were doing, they'd have found traces of blood. I need to see his quarters. You mind if I take this? You want the media? What do I do? Every second we lose in this investigation... But didn't you just say that you would do whatever you were told? I think you know what the right thing to do is. You haven't seen that soldier in here? Yeah, they were here. You do not question the witnesses. I figured somebody should. Why don't you just tell me what happened? It's complicated. Find out why they lied. It must be frustrating being surrounded by incompetent fools. I'm not the only one who made a deal. If somebody comes running at you, you kill him. You have no idea what we did over there. It's his voice on the video. What video? You're not stopped. Enough! I hated it over there. I couldn't wait to get out. After two weeks here, all I want to do is go back. I shouldn't send heroes to places like Iraq. Yes, for my health. You're a good father. You don't have to prove you loved him. You're a good father. You don't have to prove you loved him.

55100," Hey, Ma, when can I have sex? Uh, when you get your master's degree. Rosie's daughter is growing up too fast. Congratulations! You're a woman! Let the games begin! Her ex refuses to act his age. What happened to your head? I had some plugs removed because the hairs were growing into my head instead of out of it. And every day, Mother Nature reminds her she's getting older. You can job and peel and nip and tuck, but your insides are still rotting away. But love has other plans. This is Adam. No, wait. Give me a sec. How'd he do that? This guy who used to be my roommate is playing in a band on Friday night. What do you say? Okay. How old are you? Why, how old are you? Thirty-seven. What do you think? I like it. Look what happens when I do this. Then don't do that. You want to dance? I couldn't, but don't let me stop you. You're nuts. Hey, it's Friday night. I gotta bring my A game. I'm not really thirty-seven. How old are you? Thirty-eight. Thirty-one. Forty. Twenty-nine. What happened to thirty? What happened to thirty-nine? You're not even in your thirties. Well, neither are you. Where's Adam? I decided we shouldn't go out anymore. Why? I like him. I'm trying to be mature. That's not really your style. No boyfriend, no job. You happy now? This is the first guy you've dated in ten years I can actually hang out with. I am trying to be Bruce Willis. You aren't trying to be Ashton, which in turn would make her Demi. I am not Demi. You are not Ashton and you are definitely not Bruce Willis. This summer, love is about letting go. Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Would you like me to seduce you? Yes. And taking a chance. From director Amy Heckerling comes a romantic comedy for the ages. I don't care how red you are. You don't? No, I just care how much you weigh. Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd. I could never be your woman. Don't answer it. It's my mom. Hey, mom. Guess what you found in it today. Can I call you back? Yes."
55156," One is always right. One is prefabricated in purity. This is Ralph Nader's understanding of the world. The man needs to go away. I think he needs to live in a different country. In the late 60s and early 70s, Ralph would be in national polls as one of the most famous admired Americans. People would write to him thinking that he could solve their problem. Ralph had decided to do six or eight teams attacking different agencies. That was the term that stuck. Imagine if you got in a car and the airbag said, Ralph Nader, or you look at the air and it's cleaner. If people would see that on a day-to-day basis, they'd understand the effect that this guy has had on their daily life. I do think that Al Gore cost me the election. This megalomaniac thought his campaign was more important than the destruction of what he claims to stand for. We don't have a government of buying for the people. We have a government of the axons by the General Motors for the DuPonts. I wouldn't want this to hurt his legacy. I don't care about my personal legacy. He wants to be heard. Is that ego? I guess. But it's the ego of trying to make a difference."

55247," I want to buy you a new car. Why would I want a new car? Datsun runs great. I don't want anything. Everything has to be difficult. There are people in this world who go looking for adventure. Christopher McCandless was searching for himself. So you're a leather now? I'm a leather? Yeah, a leather tramp. That's what they call the ones that hoof it. Don't you think you ought to be getting a job and making something of this life? I only got one plan. I'm going to Alaska. Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska? I'm going to be all the way out there. Yeah.

This Spanish armada has its sea with an army of ten thousand men. Spanish are barely a day away, Majesty. Walter Raleigh, Majesty. This man is a pirate. Spain is no friend of England. The more gold I take, Majesty, the safer you will be. He interests me. Don't tell him. I care for your safety. The threats to your person are real.

We mortals have many weaknesses. We feel too much, hurt too much. All too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love. I envy you best. You're free to have what I cannot have. Forgive me, Majesty. I have failed you. This armada that sails against us carries the Inquisition. We cannot be defeated. The Spanish will overwhelm us. Since when were you so afraid? When the storm breaks, some are dumb with terror, and some spread their wings and soar. Let them come, we're the armies of hell. They will not come. Elizabeth! By God, England will not fall while I am cool."
55276," Michael, thank God. Look I got a situation. Arthur Edens just stripped down naked in a deposition room in Milwaukee. You are the senior litigating partner of one of the largest most respected law firms in the world. You are a legend. You are a man like Depressive. I am Shiva the god of death. I am Michael Clayton. You're late. This is a three billion dollar class action lawsuit. The architect of our defense has been arrested for running naked through a parking lot. He's building a case against you North. Nobody's gonna let him do that. Let him? Who the hell is gonna stop him? I spent 12% of my life defending the reputation of a deadly weed killer. Arthur. No wait. They killed the Michael.

We do it for you. How'd you know? How'd I know what? That you were a man. You grow up when you decide to do right. And not what's right for you, what's right for everybody. Even when it hurts.

But when you're out there with the rest of your Earthlings, you know, you've got to go by Earth rules. Was I bad? I don't care about any of that stuff. Look, this is just stuff. Come on, break it like you mean it. Over the head, come on. Just a little bit concerned here, Mr. Gordon. I'm gonna move your case up for review.

After I killed them, I walked home to await instructions. Get to Bruges. Bruges. Bruges. Where's that? It's in Belgium. For two weeks. In Bruges. In Bruges? In a room like this? With you? No way. Been to the top of the tower? Guidebook says it's a must see. Well you ain't going up there. Why? It's all windy stairs. I'm not being funny. What exactly are you trying to say? There are a bunch of elephants. Mr. Blakley? Yes. You have a message. Number one, why aren't you in when I told you to be in? You better be in when I call again or they'll be now to pay up. I'm telling you. He swears a lot, doesn't he? Let's go out. Go out where? The pub. Yes. Harry, I've got an idea. I'm going to go back to my room, jump into the canal, see if I can escape. If you go outside and round the corner, you can shoot at me from there and try and get me. I'll go outside then which way, right or left? You go right, don't you? Okay. Okay, on the count of one, two, three, go. Who says it? Oh, you say it. You guys are crazy. One, two, three, go! Ray, you're about the worst tourist in the whole world. If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't. She ain't my girlfriend. She's a prostitute. I didn't know there were any prostitutes in Bruges. I just have to look in the right places. Brothels are good. An Uzi. I'm not from the south central Los Angeles. I want a normal gun for a normal person. Maybe that's what hell is.

I still can only play all six strings or none, which is why I called myself Joe Strummer. He was instantly charismatic and he said I'm going to be a rock star. He was right. Money didn't mean anything to him but he did like fame. We're not particularly talented, we try our... It was very much being like in a 24 hour gang, you know. We only had each other. Would you like to interview our manager while he's here? He invented punk. It's obviously too much work. If the Clash could do it, you could do it. It took us back to the first excitement of hearing Rock and Roll for the first time. I really felt completely destroyed by that experience. I had to really disassemble myself and put myself back together. No more was I an adolescent. And then you meet the 17 year old guy. He's never heard of the Clash.

Summer Hartley? Go be your brilliant self. Everyone knows that the girlfriend in the beginning of this story gets dumped. Maybe Summer Hartley is my mother. It's from Emily. Did you read this? I read a page. A page? And the part about you and Emily touching each other and kissing. Oh, that part. You're a great writer. Sorry, I was just curious. I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball. Emily and I have a future we plan which may involve some type of threesome then. What's a threesome? That's a game that adults play sometimes. When they're bored. Whatever. Can I get 10 copies?

Poor April has always been a friend. Then she realized she wants to be the girlfriend. Why are you so concerned with all of this? I want you to be happy. I'm happy. Trust me, Dad. You're not happy. For Will Hayes, a second look at the past. You and me, it'd kind of be like cats and dogs. Oil and water. Sandpaper and bare ass. That's gross. Might give him a second chance for the future. This story has a happy ending. What is it? You. Definitely. Maybe. I think I discovered who my mom is in the story. Well, who is it? Not telling."

You can't give the order. You've been shot. We risked telling the world that you weren't really there. We weren't there. We need you to tell us what's going on. I think I just saw the guy who did it.

Try to please him. If you can. And what would you know of great men? I'd know one, if he were before me. Do you see one here? Looking, my lord. Ah, there. Samson. I find you much change, mistress Anne. How can you show your face in here? Now you know how it feels to be deceived by your sister. Can you give yourself to me now? I desire nothing more. What would you have me do? Hide. Can I trust her? These are dangerous times. The failure to provide a male heir has weakened the King's power. The truth will be apt, but I cannot bear children. You witch. You cursed, evil witch. I have torn this country apart for you. You're my only hope. My life depends on it. Why are you here for her? Because she's my sister."
58191," This debate is occurring because of the Supreme Court's ruling that said that we must conduct ourselves under the Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. That Common Article 3 says that there will be no outrageous upon human dignity. It's very vague. What does that mean? I know whether it was an injury that was aggravated by something or whether he would just sit coming in. I saw his picture in the New York Times article. Before that picture, I couldn't have picked his face out. My memory of him was chained up with the hood on, no sleeping. This is not a hotel. This is not a place for them to get fat and lazy and happy. They told us when dealing with the pucks, as they call them, the person's under US custody. They don't fall under Geneva Conventions. Basically, the only thing that we weren't allowed to do is beat them up. We have to work sort of the dark side, if you will. We're going to spend time in the shadows. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies. Soldiers are dying. Get the information. That's all you're told. Get the information. Sometimes I feel that I should have gone with my own morality more than what was common. Some would say, well, hey, you should have stopped this. You should have stopped that. Why didn't you do something? That'd be a good question. My answer would be, well, you know, it was us against them. I was over there. I didn't want to appear to be going against my fellow soldiers. Which, is that wrong? You could sit here and say that was dead wrong. Go over there and say that. People say, well, these photographs from our grave, they weren't real torture. I look back at those people and I say, murder's torture. Murder's the ultimate torture. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice. If they think so very little of life, and clearly 9-11 exemplified that, screw them. Anything goes."

58315," I am his holiness, the Guru Pitka. Look man, just get back on your pillow, aight? Ain't no connection between my love life and my hockey. Oh, I'm not here to work with you. I just came by to say hello and goodbye. The Love Guru, directed by Marko Schnabel, represents a return to live action movies for Mike Myers, the former Saturday Night Live cast member, who lately has been confined to doing voiceover work for Shrek. It's been five years since he last appeared in a non-animated movie. That was The Cat in the Hat. As I recall, that was a pretty terrible movie. I'm tempted to say that The Love Guru is even worse, but to really make that comparison with any authority, I'd have to go back and watch them both again. I'm sorry to say I'm not willing to do that. Oh! How did you get there? The Love Guru is one of the least funny, crudest, coarsest, most pointless movies that I've ever seen. Shrimp? What'd you call me? I'm sorry, I didn't catch your gnome. Name! Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka, who is trained by a guru whose name I can't really say on these airwaves, played by Ben Kingsley. I want to become a guru so girls will like me. Then I will like myself. Pitka's rival is Deepak Chopra. He wants to get on Oprah. He wants to be famous and rich. He wants to sleep with Jessica Alba like everybody else in the movies these days. I can't really summarize for you just what's going on in this movie and just how lame and terrible and unimaginative it is. I want to make very clear that it's not the vulgarity or the coarseness or the scatological humor or the dumb, immature sex jokes themselves that make this movie a problem. I like all of that stuff. I'd like to thank the Academy. Wow, these things are heavy. Yeah. I like it a lot when it's well done, when it's funny. But I have to say I sat through 90 minutes of The Love Guru, watching the various peepee and poo poo jokes and the elephants copulating on the ice in the middle of a Stanley Cup hockey game and the dwarfs being thrown around and the various racial and ethnic and religious slurs being batted around back and forth and Mike Myers smiling and mugging and winking his eyes and trying on funny accents. And I did not laugh once. Let's make like a baby and head out. So I have to say this more strongly than I usually do. I know there's no accounting for taste. There are some people who might be tickled by this stuff. But my very strong advice to you as your movie guru would be to avoid The Love Guru. Yes? What's the capital of Thailand? Bangkok. Exactly. Stay down."

My mother protected me from the outside world. But to break the curse, I just had to find someone to accept me as I am till death do us part. Hello, I'm Penelope. And you must be... I was ready to give up. Gotcha! Then he walked in. Go! No! I can't! Go! Hello? Penelope, I know you're in there. How about you and me heading down to the Clover Dilly Pub right now? Penelope, come on. What are you waiting for? That's better. All my life I've been rejected. Do you have any idea how that makes me feel? No! Come back! No! Now... Penelope! One girl will break away. She's out there on her own, declaring her independence. So what are you hiding from the law or is that just a bad-nosed job or something? Bad-nosed job. Experience a life she's never known. Can I have a beer on tap, please? You're supposed to catch it. You don't get out much, do you? We should talk. And inspire the world to see her. Is there anything you'd like to say to the public? Hi. For who she is. I like myself the way I am. Christina Ricci. The public loves this girl. Finger trees! James McAvoy. You know, you inspired me. Doing what you did, going off on your own like that. Katherine O'Hara. Things are different now, Mother, because I have friends. And Academy Award winner Reese Witherspoon. What's a Vespa? You know, we're written on a Vespa? Penelope.

58365," We feel that it was not only our right but our duty to go to Chicago and do what we did. Why did you come to Chicago? I'm here for two reasons. One, we're going to demonstrate against the war. Number two is just what it's called, the festival of life. They came to express themselves in peace and love. It's a groovy thing to do. We expect this to be a peaceful, nonviolent demonstration. But their voices were silenced. A democratic convention is about to begin in a police state. Witness an extraordinary recreation. We are the second American revolution. Of what happened next. Ladies and gentlemen, the jury. Based on the infamous courtroom transcripts. Intent to incite. Did you intend to incite? It's a state of mind trial. I mean, we're being tried for our thoughts. From Brett Morgan, director of The Kid Stays in the Picture. The government will prove the plan of the defendants who encouraged people to protest and riot. Comes a never before seen look at the events. Chicago has become a concentration camp. That changed a nation. This generation is going to take this country back by any means necessary. I'm probably going to get sued for that one. You can't deny me my constitutional right.

58425," I sometimes get this strange and sort of uncontrollable urge to want to go home. Kind of a safe haven for us Iceland, because we are left alone, we are on our own here. It seemed like something that we had to do was to go around and play the shows in small towns for just the people there. I think it's harder to play for people you know. We just have been traveling for a long time around the world and we wanted to come here and just play for Iceland.

58432," No, no, you're not listening. I'm driving on the 405 as we speak. I'm five minutes away. I'm driving right over the hill. Hi, Daddy. Morning, gorgeous. Mommy wants to ask you something. She said it's OK for you to go in the house instead of using your cell phone. That's good to know. OK, Ben, let's play by the rules. I thought our last session went really well, didn't you? We're running a little short on time. Why can't we talk about it? Next time. I know the time is up, but we're paying enough money. We can't stay two more minutes. Will you please, thank you very much. Ben, I've got a problem. A serious problem. Is he a final cut? I'll take the movie away from you and recut it myself. It'll be fine. It's jet lagged. I'll take care of it. It's OK. Talk to me. You're not going to believe it. He's fat. Bruce Willis is overweight. With a grizzly Adam's beard. If that bastard doesn't shave and look like a leading man, we sue you for misrepresentation. Aw, Sidney, come on. This is Bruce Willis we're talking about here. He's got four days to shave and that's it. Tell him he's going to get fired. I don't want to. You're scared of him. I'm scared of all of them. Audiences want to know it's you, Bruce. What are you talking about? They're not going to recognize me, Ben. Oh, where'd Bruce go? Oh, look, there he is. I see him right there. The guy with the beard. Why don't we start by giving your overblown stomach to the Red Cross? Yeah? I'm hurting. You're hurting? Is anyone else other than you sleeping in our old bed? What? I believe you've just seen my ex-wife. For God's sake, she married. I'm not happy. Is this a feeling that you're unfamiliar with? I'm not just some silly girl in tight clothes. I'm with Stanford. That's a good school. Hunter S. Thompson once said to me that movie business is a cruel and shallow money trench. You live up to it. Where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs. And then he added, there's also a negative side. As we dig deeper and deeper, you're going to feel so good about being apart that you're never going to want to get back together."

And if you're uncomfortable, we can always give you more. Is this an improvement, or are we making things worse? How often do you get to see a fully natural birth? Rarely. Almost never. Everywhere else in the world, you see midwives attending 70 or 80% of all the births. And the United States stands alone. You want to talk big lobby, big dollars. They can kind of call a lot of shots. Accusations tonight that some hospitals are not being upfront with patients who are expecting a baby. Caesarian is extremely doctor-friendly. It's 20 minutes, and I'll be home for dinner. Basically, what the medical profession has done is convince the vast majority of women that they don't know how to birth. If I could do that, I could do anything. To me, that's the power of birthing, and that is what we are taking away from women. It wasn't an illness. It wasn't something that needed to be numbed. It needed to be experienced. It was the most adventurous day I've ever had in my life. I don't even have a diaper. I don't even have a bath mat. I have to get there. I cannot have another contraction of this taxi cab. Switch on a light switch, and you go to the moon. This is what I was after. This is what I wanted for my child.

58998," Are you breaking up with me? Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a new comedy directed by Nicholas Stoller from a screenplay by Jason Siegel, who is also the star of the movie and he appears completely naked not once but twice. Do you want to put some clothes on? Would you like to pick out the outfit that you break up with me in? This is the latest product from the Judd Apatow Comedy Factory and if you liked movies like Knocked Up, Superbad, The 40 Year Old Virgin, you'll probably like this one too. Mr. Siegel plays a guy named Peter who is brutally dumped by his girlfriend of five years played by Kristen Bell. That's the Sarah Marshall of the title. And after she dumps him, she takes off for Hawaii with a sex crazed rock star played by Russell Brand, who's in some ways the funniest person in the movie. Peter? Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? Came here to murder you. Peter ends up at the same Hawaiian resort and all kinds of awkward misunderstandings and collisions ensue and meanwhile he starts an infatuation and a flirtation with Rachel, a receptionist at the resort played by Mila Kunis. Are you gonna jump or what? I'll jump. Just let me be. As is often the case with these movies, the real fun comes when the supporting players show up on the scene to make funny jokes and rifts. So we have Bill Hader and Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd and a lot of the usual characters in the Apatow universe. And my Hawaiian name is Kunu. One of the frustrating things about this movie is that I would like to see these movies start to develop the female characters a little more and give them some more comic opportunities and also maybe narrow the gap a little bit in terms of how slovenly and unattractive the men are allowed to be and how hot and babylicious the women are expected to be. You need to get back on that board. Oh, wow. Wow, wow. You got coral on your leg. Can you get it out of my leg please, O.T.L., man? You sound like you're from London."

What am I gonna do without you? I think you'll be fine. Hello? Hey, how's the weather in England? I'm in Scotland. So it's sunny. It's three in the morning. So it's dark. I'm gonna go back to sleep now. Oh, I hate Scotland. What's the matter with you today? Maybe there's more to life than just sleeping around. I don't understand. I'm not following. I'm gonna tell Hannah. When she gets home, I'm gonna tell her that I want to be with her. You okay? I'm engaged. You proposed and I accepted. Wow, this is beautiful. If you're getting married, I'd expect to be your best man. Uh-huh. Tom, will you be my maid of honor? You're maid of honor? What is it with you, man? I didn't mean it. Maid of honor. You might have to do this. You be a confidant. You'll be able to help me pick out someone for the wedding night. No. What are you looking at? Nothing. You got a better chance of stopping this wedding from inside than from another contest. Hannah has showers in the morning. We gotta get these baskets done. What about this party mix? It's potpourri. Oh, God. This must be the lucky young man who's marrying our beautiful Hannah. Oh, no. I'm not marrying him. This is Tom, my maid of honor. Oh. Well, how about that? We have many gay and lesbian members of the congregation. Welcome."

Truth is, all my heroes had a dirty little secret. Sylvester Stallone has been charged with importing bodybuilding drugs. Today, Hogan admits the famous physique was the result of 12 years of steroids. I was always against steroids. And when I found out that all my heroes used them, I'd like to say it didn't bother me, but it really did. I can't imagine how my mom would feel if she found out that both of my brothers are on steroids right now. Coaches would say, you gotta get bigger. You gotta get stronger. You gotta get faster. Was it intimidating? Oh, man. I need to attain greatness. I need to do it. If you had to take a drug with the known side effects of the anabolic steroids to keep your job right now and support your family, would you do it? I love steroids. They'll probably be on and off them forever. The use of performance enhancing drugs like steroids sends the wrong message. When you were an Olympic coach, did you see a lot of steroid use going on? I mean, I want to stay feminine. Yeah. Oh my Lord. Oh. Steroids? I love it when they're on my team. It's human nature. People cheated everything. Why am I the bad guy? Because you're on steroids. There is a clash in America between doing the right thing. In sports, you should play fair. And being the best. In war, you shouldn't play fair at all. And we're a Schwarzenegger in all this. One thing I learned about America is that if you work hard. I mean, he is the poster boy for steroids. And if you play by the rules. You cheat. Everybody cheats. You cannot cheat anything. There's something simply un-American about this. President Bush allotted $15 million for steroid education. Where has that money gone? I don't know. Do you know? Okay, we don't know."

Unfortunately for us, blind vets tend to vote Democratic. We may well have won this election. Holy! Bring this election in for a landing. Bring it in for a landing. With George W. Bush in the cockpit. I cannot accept returns after the certification deadline unless there is a hurricane. Does your makeup count as a hurricane? This is a street fight for the Presidency of the United States. It never ceases to amaze me. The extent that Democrats will lie, cheat, and steal to win an election. The Republicans are the ones that are creating chaos. We're right on the goal line here. Just shut it down. Who actually won this election? Who won it? I should tell you, you're probably going to lose tomorrow. It's certainly one of two possibilities."

Maryland. White House officials claim the CIA has a defense against chemical weapons. I don't understand what you're saying. She says everyone's dead outside. What's going on? We lost contact. With who? Everyone. The government's testing something there that went wrong. The affected area now includes California. The authorities are not feeling by the sheer numbers of attacks that a terrorist group being responsible for is becoming less and less likely. Science will come up with some reason to put in the books. But in the end it will be just a theory. We will fail to acknowledge that there are forces at work beyond our understanding. Thank you."

And those are the two characters that absolutely everybody knows. There are aspects of my personality that I can't control. See a shrink? It's a little bit more complicated than that. Bruce, trust me when I tell you I've heard them all. Not this one. The Incredible Hulk is reimagining from what we've done before, which is important to the character. But the other thing equally important is the great TV series that everyone remembers. When they pitched me this idea of Man on the Run, the way the TV show was structured, escaping the law, I was really intrigued. It was really very emotional. It was about the character, trying to create a foundation of a new life. The target is a fugitive from the US government. The film starts with Banner, who's on the run from the law, actively looking for a cure. He's gone around the world. He's wanting to come home. I don't want to control it. I want to get rid of it. But then it's still you inside it. No. The good guys have this power, want to get rid of it. The bad guys don't have this power, love it, and want to harvest it. As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is property of the US Army. I've run into bad situations before. This is a whole new level of weird. Neil Blonsky is a soldier who thirsts for power and strength, who undergoes a very similar process to what Bruce Banner undergoes by transforming into a creature who is much stronger than the Hulk. And that's the abomination. There's only one thing that can fight that. It's in me. In our movie, it's a journey of acceptance. Anger can easily be transformed into courage, and that's what we're going to see. Hulk is hero is what we're focusing on for this movie. So you're going to have all of the action and all the spectacle that comes with Hulk."

60135," In 1956, after years of insomnia, after years of anxiety, I embarked upon an odyssey. Dorian Paskiewicz is a 58-year-old doctor who one day decided to give it all up and spend the rest of his life traveling with his family in a tiny camper from one wave to another. He wanted us to be unchained to a mortgage. A moment's notice, just get in and go. We'd wake up one morning and we'd be in Pensacola. Wake up another morning, we'd be in purpose Christie, San Francisco, Baja, Florida, Venezuela, New Mexico, Alabama, El Paso. We'd just burn the moment, go wherever. Open the camper door, go out to your thing, lunch is at noon. We were not attached to the physical world at all. In some little town in Louisiana, we pulled over into the state park and he says, guys, there it is. We're down to our last dime. And he was excited. For 10 years, I was either pregnant or breastfeeding without one day off. When you have nine children living in a 24-foot camper, you have these flare-ups. Eat healthy, live clean, serve clean. Dorian had us in such a tight diet. We couldn't have refined sugar, we couldn't have white bread. He fed us branches for breakfast. I wasn't some kind of radical. He used to play Chairman Mao's wake-up song to the nation every single morning. They go to a school I consider enormously demanding. I demand that they serve and be good at it. We would confront him on a daily basis. I want to go to high school. We did everything the hard way. If it was easy, then something was wrong. They're lazy. He's a dictator. He was Fidel. I swear I'd never serve again, ever. Your parents said you can go to school because it's safe, but don't go swimming with sharks because it's dangerous. Our parents said you can go swimming with sharks, but you would have to go to school because that is dangerous. Nobody would ever believe the experiences my brothers and I had together. I wouldn't change that for anything in the world. The good outweigh the bad. It's almost like a dream. Everyone's trying to get that spiritual moment of perfection. We had it. We lived it. I intend to put my kids through what my dad put me through. I'm going to keep the dream alive. Wisdom you get from experience, and that is what my children had a lot of."

Because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. He was a reporter with a wild imagination. He was not afraid to express himself in sometimes shocking ways. I'm not at all embarrassed at the use of the word freak. Here in the middle of Las Vegas it starts off like a rocket. That was a mad genius. Ralph, when he first met Hunter, he'd never done any drugs. He loses it. Hunter always had to have a running crisis. I'm over here. I'm going to kill somebody. Hunter saw guns as one of the great things in life. He liked the noise and the violence and the destruction. I think he was important in a literary way and also in a political way. Hunter was in Chicago right in the midst of the gas and the beatings. I came up with the idea that he should move to Washington becoming a full-time correspondent. When he showed up at the KMPA, no wonder he was. Until he started publishing, then all hell broke loose. Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for objective journalism, which is true, but they miss the point. He described me as a half-crazed Davy Crockett running around the parapets of Nixon's Alamo. I desperately wanted to put an end to that senseless war. I'm sick and tired of old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in. Hunter's pieces were a hybrid of very accurate reportage and sometimes flat-out fantasy. And it ended up on the wires, a straight story. You finally said, well, you made it all up. I couldn't believe it. People really believed that Muskie was getting even game. I never said he was. I said there was a rumor in Milwaukee that he was, which was true. And I started the rumor in Milwaukee. I think he captured certain truths about human perversity. I don't think that anybody can be surprised that we find ourselves in the nightmare we're in today because of the same as the nightmare he described back then. He could wielded a pretty effective sword against what's going on right now. He had this purity of vision. Will the real Hunter Thompson please stand up? As long as I can feel alive."

60857," I came from a hole, you know? The Tracy Fragments is a new film from the Canadian director Bruce MacDonald. It stars Ellen Page, who was the title character in Juno. She plays Tracy Berkowitz, a 15-year-old girl in what looks like Winnipeg, Canada, who spends a rather eventful 24 or 48 hours running around the city looking for her younger brother, who's disappeared. Now that's a straightforward description of the plot, and the movie does have one, which is fairly lurid and melodramatic in places. Tracy has parents who don't really understand her, or borderline abusive who send her to a shrink. She has a crush on a new kid at school. She's picked on and abused and humiliated by the mean girls at school. There's a lot of the baggage of a standard teenage melodrama. I can't tell you what, or you'll end up like me on this bus looking for someone. What's interesting about this movie is the technique that Mr. MacDonald uses to tell the story, which is not only to tell it out of chronological order in a very sort of impressionistic way so that a scene flows into a scene backwards and forwards, but also using a split-screen technique, really a multiple-window technique almost, where the screen sometimes divides in two, three, four, even as many as a hundred different images that overlap and play off each other and kind of suggest a free associative psychological logic rather than an objective narrative logic to the story. My name is Tracy Berkowitz, 15, just a normal girl who hates herself. And this makes a big difference. It takes what I think would have felt like an overdone, overwrought, almost by-the-numbers study of teenage unhappiness and really turns it into an exploration of this girl's psychological state. So part of what happens is that you don't necessarily know in any given scene whether something is happening in her head or being kind of filtered and distorted from her perspective or actually really happening to her. So what you get is a very powerful study in moods and emotions, in the anger, the sexual vulnerability, the fear, the self-confidence, all of the different emotions that kind of buffet this young girl who's wonderfully played by Ellen Page, who's just a terrifically smart actress, and who helps to make this movie that, again, I think might not have been convincing if it had been done another way into something that's really powerful and unusual and interesting. There's something you're not telling us. Tracy, is there anything you're not telling us? I'm a very passionate person."

63062," Our thoughts go out again today to Mrs. Christine Collins of Lincoln Heights whose young son Walter Collins disappeared nearly two weeks ago. Though she is not a member of our congregation, we pray for her today as we have every day since we learned of her plight. On the radio and in the newspapers we are told that the Los Angeles Police Department is doing its very best to reunite mother and child and I'm sure that that is true. But given its status as the most violent, corrupt and incompetent police department this side of the Rocky Mountains, I am not sure it's saying a great deal. Every day new bodies appear along Mulholland and in the ditches of our cities the work of Police Chief James Davis and his aptly named gun squad. Every day the needs of honest citizens are put second to greed and personal gain. Every day this city sinks deeper into a cesspool of fear, intimidation and corruption. Once the City of Angels, Los Angeles has become a place where our protectors have become our brutalizers, where to be the law is to be above the law. Thank you."

65188," I'm gonna be a good storyteller. He had a present. He had the worst possible gas. He's gonna be a great doctor. He's crying. Well the phrase I was gonna use had been, uh, full of life. Do you know who that is? Andrew. I, I didn't have to get killed. I'm an only child and I'll get around to why this is of any importance whatsoever. When I had to say, was my son murdered? And take that into your soul and then to know how cold bloodedly he was murdered. He wanted to break up with her. Oh she said that's it then. She was dumped again. Unfortunately she made it to Canada before they could arrest her. On the afternoon of November 7th, 2001 my sister called to tell me that Dr. Andrew Bagby, my closest friend since the age of seven, had been killed. My name's Kurt and I'm a filmmaker. Andrew appeared in every movie I made growing up. Jesus Christ, Kurt what do you want? No, no, I just need, I'm just- I decided to make a movie to travel far and wide to interview everyone who ever knew and loved Andrew. Kurt, I just got a call from Mrs. Bagby. The abbreviated version is that bitch held a press conference and announced that she's four months pregnant with Andrew's baby. They can't prove it until the child's born. If it is true, the Bagbys are gonna supercut seats. She named the little boy Zachary. To seek custody of the only grandson they would ever have, Andrew's parents moved to St. John's, Newfoundland where Shirley Turner was unbelievably allowed to walk free on bail while awaiting extradition. In order to see Zachary, Kate and David were forced to stomach a civil relationship with the woman they knew murdered their only son. I now had a mission. My movie might be one of the only ways Zachary could see and get to know his father. So I pointed the van east toward Newfoundland and set off on a quest to bring a man back to life. I thought I never could have guessed what would happen next."

What do we take you on? This is the one place in all of Belorussia where a Jew can be free. In our darkest moments, when life flashes before us, we find something. Something that keeps us going. Nothing is impossible! What we all have done is impossible! Everybody gets to stay! We have to be able to move to the end. The Talmud says, if you save a life, you must take responsibility for it. And they spread the rules. That are no longer fit to lead us. Maybe they're right. Tuvia, do we stay or do we go? We cannot make mistakes, Tuvia. Every day of freedom is like an act of faith.

Mark showed you that four white guys in suits getting together in the middle of the day, that's not a business, meaning it's a crime scene. There's something you're not telling us. Why would I hide anything from you guys? We're going to find out what's going on, Mark. FBI. What the heck is going on here? Mr. Whitaker, would you please come with me? Oh yeah, I was good, right?

I'm a person of interest in an ongoing investigation. Oh my God. You guys still think I'm going to be okay at the company, right? I mean, you guys are going to take down the bad guys, but I'll be okay, right? Well, I think the corporate culture is going to change a little bit for you. I should say so.

Peanut butter contaminated with salmonella. E. coli has been found in spinach, apple juice. Smells like money to me. -♪ The average consumer does not feel very powerful. It's the exact opposite. -♪ When we run an item past the supermarket scanner, we're voting for local or not, organic or not. Look at the tobacco industry. The battle against tobacco is a perfect model of how an industry's irresponsible behavior can be changed. -♪ Imagine what it would be if, as a national policy, the idea would be to have such nutritionally dense food that people actually felt better, had more energy, and weren't sick as much.

If you miss this island, you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go. I understand the danger I can handle. You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you? No one has made it. I will. Did you receive transmission? I'll make it. I know I will. Now go tell the world you're on your way."
71899," In cities and suburbs, all over the world, there are those who find life a little confusing. Who find the things that people say, the things they do, the stuff that just happens. White or wilder, but sometimes those who find the world in... find each other. Dear Max, I am eight years old. It would be great if you could be my friend. Dear Mary, thank you for the letter. I find the world very chaotic. Because my mind is very literal and logical. Where do babies come from in America? In Australia, they are found in beer glasses. Here is a drawing of me. Babies are laid by Catholic nuns. If you're an atheist, they're laid by 30 lonely prostitutes. My mother likes smoking and sharing. My father left my mother when I was six. He shot himself with my uncle's joint. Can you explain love? How could he kill for that? Kisses me without my permission. I know love upsets you, so I won't go on about it. Love is obviously not for me. Dear Mary, you are my best friend. You are my only friend. Mary and Max. P.S. Do you know that turtles can breathe through their anuses? Ooh!"
72011," Last year I flew 350,000 miles. All the things you probably hate about traveling are warm reminders that I am home. Welcome back, Mr. Bingham. I am a passenger. I work for a company that lends me out to cowards that don't have the courage to sack their own employees and for good reason. Who are you, man? Because people do crazy stuff when they get fired. I'm gonna need your key card. We received a dynamite young woman from Cornell. Natalie Keener. I want you to show her the ropes. I'm not a tour guide. Show her the magic. Take her through the paces. What? Follow me. You never get behind bold people. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal. Bingo. Asians. They pack light, travel efficiently, and they got a thing for slip-on shoes. God love them. That's racist. I'm like my mother. I stereotype. It's faster. You gotta fill me in on the miles thing. What is that about? I fly on grabbing as many miles as I can. What's your total? Is it this big? Uh. This big? I don't wanna brag. This is pretty sexy. We're two people who get turned on by elite status. Good call on that towel rack. Shame we didn't make it to the closet. We gotta do this again. What kind of relationship do you have? You know that moment when you look into somebody's eyes and you can feel them staring into your soul and the whole world goes quiet? Yes. Right. Well, I don't. You have set up a way of life that basically makes it impossible for you to have any kind of human connection. You're grounded. Everybody's grounded. They're pulling us off the road. We're going home. If you think about it, your favorite memories, the most important moments in your life. Were you alone? Life's better with company. Everybody needs a co-pilot. That was a nice touch. Thanks. Up in the air. I'm not really sure how long this whole exercise is supposed to last. No, I don't even think of him that way. He's old.

72129," You think it's the living that will have ultimate judgment over you. What are you doing, Bill? What do you want? Because the dead will have no claim over your soul. No, I'm not gonna die! I'm not gonna die! But you may be mistaken. But I am still among you. When faced with death, who should live versus who will live are two entirely separate worlds. If it's Halloween, it must be Saw. You will be put to the death. Saw VI. He helped me."

When MJ comes in the room, his presence is just amazing. That's why I write these kind of songs. It gives some sense of awareness and awakening and hope to people.

Surveillance does. I hate those. It's fantastic. Get aboard your prugnus for print. Oh my gosh, is that the new Chevalier book? You stole my story. Awesome.

74545," Hi, I'm Dan Ireland. This is the trailer from Hell. One of my favorite directors of all time is the brilliant Roman Polanski. I think maybe Chinatown is perhaps my favorite film. And I made a confession that Roger Ebert had seen La Dolce Vita 25 times. I have a confession. I have seen Chinatown in a theater 112 times. So as many hours as Roger spent with La Dolce Vita, I spent with Roman Polanski on Chinatown. I first was attracted to Roman Polanski in his films of repulsion called A Sack. He was one of the directors that really could truly reinvent himself with every film and yet really maintain a signature and a stamp. And here, now it's the millennium, he's back with a brilliant film, The Ghost Rider. You realize I know nothing about politics. You voted for him, didn't you? Actor Piers Brosnan gives his best work in this film. He's playing a British Prime Minister who's being accused of terrorism, and he really is funny. He's funny, terrifying, and wonderful, and matches Ewan McGregor's perfect Ghost Rider. The other people that surprised me were actress Kim Cattrall, who I really only knew from Sex and the City, and to see there and watch Kim do a British accent and really match Olivia Williams was something else. But the really incredible thing about Ghost Rider is, unfortunately, Roman Polanski was incarcerated when he went to the Zurich Film Festival, and the film was in the can, but it wasn't through the editorial process. So Roman Polanski edited this film probably a lot from jail on the telephone or maybe Skype, and the result is just absolutely staggering. It is taut, it is suspenseful. Olivia Williams is one of my favorite actors. The other thing is the locations of this film, even though Polanski was not allowed on this territory in America, he went and found a place in Germany and really recreated the East Coast perfectly. When you go into the office and see Ewan McGregor working and you look out the windows there, that's all green screen. Another thing of note on this film is the staggering score by Alexander Desplat. It is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann and also Polanski's original composer from his early films, Christopher Kameda. The Ghost Rider is really a Roman Polanski treat. If you have not seen it, if you missed it in the theatre, see it now."

I usually am enjoying myself and I'm hardly ever depressed anymore. I never thought that I would ever get to that point. I never really tried to do anything scandalous in my life. It was amazing. It was just like instant success and fame. I've thought about dying all my life like a normal person.

80185," In 2006, filmmaker Josh Fox received a letter in the mail offering him $100,000 for permission to drill for natural gas on his land. He knew that in 2005, Congress had passed a bill exempting gas companies from environmental regulations. He wanted to know what impact the drilling would have on his land, so he took his camera across the United States to discover the truth about hydraulic fracturing. The method of gas drilling they use is called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. It blasts a mix of water and chemicals 8,000 feet into the ground. The fracking itself is like a mini earthquake. The intense pressure breaks apart the rock and frees up the gas. Six states have documented over 1,000 incidents of groundwater contamination. It bubbles and hisses when it comes out. I won't drink it. They can drill whether we like it or not. It's a free-for-all. Our water was good before they started drilling, and when they got done it was bad. Obviously we have a problem here. The Colorado Oil and Gas Commission is aware of the situation and will probably be doing some additional testing in the area as soon as possible. There has been concern raised about the methods to tap these valuable resources. They have been characterized as environmentally risky and inadequately regulated. Such reports are not accurate. The neurological effects are very insidious. Everybody was sick, including me. I have these lesions in my brain. You get pains, pains all over your body. If you weren't able to do this hydraulic fracturing, how much more would we be dependent on foreign oil and terrorism? I have one quote here from you that says that you're trying to do this in a way that doesn't damage the environment. You also said recently that water contamination is inevitable. Well, yeah. I mean... Are those contradictory? No. Despite documented health risks and environmental impact, hydraulic fracturing is spreading across the globe. It's amazing that what took Mother Nature millions of years to build can be destroyed in a few hours with a piece of heavy machinery. What it's doing is searching for a problem that does not exist. Whoa! Jesus Christ! It's not supposed to do that. It's not supposed to do that."

80549," Let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story. And this is my side. The right one. I used to be anonymous. And nothing. And non-entity. Olive. That's your name, right? Yeah. We've had nine classes together since kindergarten. So here it is. Part one. Do you want to go out with me? Brandon, just a couple hours ago you told me you were gay. You said I should pretend to be straight. I didn't mean with me. I am tormented every day at school. Just one good imaginary fling. Which brings us to part two. You said Olive with Brandon? No grunt. They make it convincing. You ready for the grand finale? What? Oh! Yeah! Thank you. What's up? I always thought that pretending to lose my virginity would be a little more special. Judy Blume should have prepared me for that. Brandon told me what you did for him. No. He told me the truth. I was just hoping that maybe you could do the same for me. So whether I liked it or not, I was open for business. 20% off to Bath and Body Works? Is that how much our imaginary trust meant to you? I fake rocked your world. We need to pray for her. But we also need to get her the hell out of here. Amen. On Monday, things took a turn for the scandalous. Screw all these people, Olive. Ironically, we were studying this scarlet letter. This girl named Hester Prynne has an affair with the minister, is besmirched, and made to wear a red A for adulterer. Perhaps you should embroider a red A on your wardrobe. I'm not proud of this. No judgment. But you kind of look like a stripper. Mom! A high-end stripper for governors or athletes. Is she the one everyone's talking about? Yes. I know exactly what you're doing. If I promise not to tell anyone, could I kiss you right now? I had a similar situation when I was your age. I had a horrible reputation. Why? Because I slept with a whole bunch of people. Mostly guys. Mom! I'm not going to lie. I was a little girl. I was a little girl. I was a little girl. I was a little girl. I was a little girl. I was a little girl. I was a little girl.

Since I was 15, I've either been with a guy... Your underwear, my queen. Just folded my delegates. You are in so much trouble. Or breaking up with a guy. I haven't had so much as two weeks just to deal with myself. What did you have for lunch today? I don't know. A salad? Exactly. I used to have this appetite for food, for life, and it's just gone. I want to go someplace where I can marvel at something. I'm going to Italy, India, and I'm going to end the year in Bali. I love you and I'm proud of you. You put the water in the tub.

80553," Why don't you tell me how you started writing poetry? I started writing poetry because I fell in love and I needed to express my feelings. Howl. I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical, naked. Would you say that Howl, the poem by Ginsburg, is obscene? Yes. Holy, holy, holy. If it has any literary value, it's negligible. Holy Kerouac, holy Cassidy, who blew and were blown by those human seraphim. You feel like you're going through the gutter when you read that stuff. Now you understand what blue and blown mean. I realized that poetry is a rhythmic articulation of feeling. What is obscenity and to whom? Ginsburg's life apparently has had this kind of rhythm. Oh, skinny legions, run outside. There are books that have the power to change men's minds. The eternal war is here. Let there be no running from nonexistent destroyers of morals. Oh, victory. Let there be light. We're free. What is the beat generation? There's no beat generation. Just a bunch of guys trying to get published."

Hey, where's your girlfriend? And that was just the beginning. Through the years, my parents hoped I would grow up right and get a good education. Is that a rooster? No, it looks like a chicken. How can you tell? A rooster's a chicken. The question is, are they all hens? Do roosters strut? Yes, they do. Just shoot me now. Careful what you wish for. I'm just not so sure I got the education they had in mind. I need your sharpener. You've heard of knocking? Hey, what you got there, Dad's Playboy? None of your business. Get my best, Miss October.

And how do you talk to them? I can't. My dad needs me to help him fix a thing. What's going on with you and Bryce Lusky? What do you mean? Nothing. Oh, okay. But one day, I started getting this really weird feeling. Somewhere between confusion and absolute terror. There's a bee in her hair. There's no bee. Are you freaking mental? Julie Baker, you hate her. That's what's so weird. I don't think I do. She's quite a girl. Every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent. And when you do, nothing will ever compare.

80590," I'm sorry. Someone reminded me I once said greed is good. Now it seems it's legal. Because everybody's drinking the same Kool-Aid. Now I've been considered a pretty smart guy. And maybe I was in prison too long. One watch and one mobile phone. But sometimes it's the only place to stay sane. And look out through those bars and say, is everybody out there nuts? Gordon Gekko was one of the biggest names on Wall Street before he went to prison for insider trading. That name doesn't mean anything anymore. If it weren't for people who took risks, where would we be in this world? It's not when a wiper's in the drawer up your face. Mr. Gekko! My name is Jacob Moore. I'm gonna marry your daughter. My daughter hasn't spoken to me in years, and you know it. I never knew my dad as a peaceful person. That always scared me. I know it sounds crazy, but people change. He's not who you think he is, Jake. He'll hurt us. Why don't you start calling me Gordon? You're gonna be part of the family business. You got my attention. But when you don't know what you're doing... It's fatal, Mr. Moore. So much you don't know, Jacob. They took my life, and when I got out, who's waiting for me? Nobody! This is not about the money. This is about you and me. It's about doing the right thing. It's about the game. I did tell you, Jake. I did warn you. It's easy to get in. It's hard to get out. Is that a threat? Absolutely."

A certain little girl once did and she got into a hole, poor kid. Yes, she got into a hole of a bunny, old bunny and down, down, down she slid. And she got into a hole, poor kid. And she slid, of course you understand. The girl was Alice, and little Alice was thrilled she could be. The place was Wonderland, where even rabbits had human habits, the land of Tweedledum and Tweedledee. In the kitchen was an ugly cook, and the Duchess with an ugly look. And the Duchess had a baby that was turned into a pig, and the cook was a bear when she flung kitchenware. Alice even saw their queen, but she didn't even dare to call. If you whispered when the queen made a ruling, no fooling, she had your head chopped off. The devil was a scene, so topsy-curvy, but she was nervy and didn't even scream, but she was made a queen. And had a palace, and little Alice awoke and found a Wonderland, a dream. © BF-WATCH TV 2021"

80969," I'm 28 years old. I now spend most of my time not looking forwards, but looking back in what happened to us at Halsham. Catch it, Tommy! Why didn't Tommy get the ball? There was once a boy who had ran off beyond the boundary. They found him in the woods with his hands and feet cut off. Who told you these stories? Everybody knows them. And how do you know they're true? You make up stories as horrible as that. Students of Halsham are special. Keeping yourselves well, keeping yourselves healthy inside is of paramount importance. None of you will do anything except live the life that has already been set out for you. And sometime around your third donation, your short life will be complete. That's what you're created to do. We were moved from Halsham at 18. Tommy, Ruth and I. Exactly how much experience have you guys had with the outside? Quite a lot. We haven't. Drinks? Five cokes, please. If there was a boy and a girl and they were properly in love and they could prove it, then they would be given a few years together before they began their donations. Why do you do that thing? Squeezing Tommy's shoulder. I'm allowed to touch Tommy, aren't I? It's the way you're touching him. Suppose for a second that there is a special arrangement for Halsham students if they're in love. Although Tommy really likes you as a friend, he just doesn't see you that way. We are modeled on trash. We're in love. And it's true love. It's verifiable. We didn't have to look into your souls. We had to see if you had souls at all. I wish I could help you, you poor creatures. Maybe none of us really understand what we've lived through or feel we've had enough time."

81158," I've been on about four or five different types of sleeping pills to know them help. That's how bad the nightmares are. I prefer not to sleep and not dream about it than sleep and just see the picture in my head is pretty bad. This is the southern Cornwall. Deadliest place on earth, the Cornwall Valley. We're not ready for this. Get the fuck over here! You're in no man's land. Where the road ends, Taliban begins. Holy shit, did everybody from the entire country come to this valley? Is there nobody else fighting anymore? Is every bad guy in my face? We can make more money, make you guys richer. What I need though, is I need you to join with the government. The fear is always there. We're going to die here. Fucking Christ. Say a prayer and move on. You can't get a better high. It's like crack, you know? Once you've been shot at, you really can't come down. You can't top that. How are you going to go back to the civilian world then? I have no idea. Hey babe, I miss you. Can we get home and..."
81191," I don't know what college I want to go to, but I know I want to be a teacher. I want to be a nurse. I want to be a doctor. How come? Because I would like to help somebody in need. You wake up every morning and you know that kids are getting a really crappy education right now. So you think that most of the kids here are getting a crappy education right now? Oh, I don't think they are. I know they are. Either the kids are getting stupider every year or something is wrong in the education system. I just try to do my best in school and make my grandmother proud. Among 30 developed countries, we rank 25th in math and 21st in science. In almost every category, we've fallen behind, except one. Kids from the USA rank number one in confidence. I think about 60,000 people have gone to this school in 40 years. 40,000 didn't graduate. This is the damage that this school has done to this neighborhood. A child that doesn't finish high school will earn less and be eight times more likely to go to prison. I want to go to school. For these kids, their only chance at getting into a great school depends on whether their number is picked in a lottery. So if Francisco doesn't get in, is there another chance? No. Your children and future generations are on the bridge of the Titanic and everybody's going to drown. Someone is taking an interest in you, someone loves you, and they recognize the importance of education. And the first student selected? 20. Nine. It takes a lot of outrage and a lot of good examples to say, yes, we can do this. When you see a great teacher, you are seeing a work of art. I want my kids to have better than what I have. 18. 10. 12. 2. And the last number?"
81229," Don't make any sudden moves. Don't talk about satellites. Seriously? Why would I be trying to kill you? Because the last time we met, I tried to kill you. That was a long time ago. Some people hold on to things like that. They used to be the CIA's top agents. Victoria, best wet work asset in the business. What? What's that? I kill people, dear. But the secrets they know... This is off the books, total blackout. ...just made them the agency's top targets. Tell me everything you know. Some thumb sucker tagged him red. Red? Retired, extremely dangerous. Yeah, hey, don't make them like that anymore. We're going to break into the CIA and find out who's trying to kill us. We're getting the band back together. I put a few things away. Just in case. I am excited. What do you suppose the punishment is? For what we're doing here. Death. Awesome. I thought it might be nice to have a bit of girl time together. You can't touch me. Of course we can. That's right, old man. Old man? No respect. Old man my ass."

81537," Where's your dad? Uh, no idea. When's the last time you saw him? 1977. He had his bags packed by the front door and he picked them up, put them in the back of his car and drove away. Last time I ever saw him. That is so funny! Oh my gosh! My dad would never do that. He loved me. If you're going to travel with me to Los Angeles, I've got to give you a couple of guidelines. Number one, don't ask me a single question. What's your favorite color? What age did you lose your virginity? Do you like hot dogs? I once ate a foot long corn dog on a nude beach. I'll never do that again. Number two, if you're allergic to waffles, don't eat waffles! Then don't take me to a waffle house! If I miss the birth of my child, I'm going to choke you out with your own scarf. Wrap that thing around your neck and choke you out. Seems a bit drastic. Holy moly, it's like I'm traveling with a child! Did you use the restroom? Good point, I need to take a pee-pee. Check this thing out. I can't believe I did that. It burns! Don't panic! Don't panic! I'll see if the rental agreement's in the... What? You know what? I have coverage. Is that a drainage ditch coming up? Yes it is. Real hard. Old Sonny. Nope. Hand me that dog, I will rip it in half. You better check yourself before you wreck yourself."

This morning on the boulder we have a very special guest, Erin Rolston! Oh gosh, it's a real pleasure to be here, thank you. Thank you. You lost? I'm a guide? What'd he say? See, I'm something of a big hard hero. Oh yeah, so remember, everything will be okay. Oh my god! Erin! Are you okay, Erin? Come on! You gotta come down here! It's been nice knowing you, babe. I can do everything on my own. See ya! Bye! I don't think we figured in his day at all. Hey there, Erin. Is it true? You didn't tell anyone where you were going. Oops. Oops. I'm sorry. This marks 24 hours of being stuck. I've been chipping away. I want to keep warm than anything. I have about 150 milliliters of water left, which should keep me alive till tomorrow night. I'm lucky. So that's it. Mom, Dad, I haven't appreciated you as I know that I could. I love you guys and I'll always be with you. Don't give up, Erin. Do not give up. You"
81564," I had a fairly standard childhood. Hurry, there isn't much time. With parents who couldn't wait to get me out of the house. You are destined for greatness. That was a lot of expectation to place on an eight-day-old. Turns out another family in the Glaupunk Quadrant had a very similar idea. That was the day I met Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. And our glorious rivalry was born. Our battles quickly got more elaborate. You've fallen right into my trap. You can't trap justice. He would win some, I would almost win others. He took the name Metro Man. I decided to pick something a little more humble. Megamind. Incredibly handsome master of all villainy. This November. All right, put your hands in the air. Yeah, Metro City! I love you, Metro Man! And I love you, random citizen. The battle between good and evil. Megamind. Will blow your mind. This will be the last you ever hear of Roxanne Richie. Don't panic, Roxie. I'm not panicking. I'm on my way. Oh, I'm shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots. Will Ferrell. Tina Fey. Wow, that was really exciting. Jonah Hill. I'd be watching you like a dingo watches a human baby. And Brad Pitt. That's right. Your plans never work. You're so predictable. You call this predictable? Alligators, yes. I was thinking about it on the way over. Boom. In your face. Juvenile. So scary! This thing behind it. Tacky. What's this one do? Garish. The spider's new. Spider? Yes. The spiiter. Even the smallest bite from Arachnus deathicus will instantly paralyze. Ow! Get it off! DreamWorks Megamind in 3D."
81591," I had the craziest dream last night about a girl who was turned into a swan, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself. He promised to feature me more this season. Well, he should. You've been there long enough. And you're the most dedicated dancer in the company. Our new swan queen, the exquisite Nina Sayers. I'm Lily. You're gonna be amazing. Watch the way she moves. Essential. She's not faking it. Seduce us. Attack it. Attack it. Come on. Where'd you get these? It's nothing. You sweet girl. Feel my touch. Feel my touch. Respond to it. Because someone's hot for a teacher. I don't want to talk about that. You really need to relax. It's the role, isn't it? It's all this pressure. I knew it'd be too much. I knew it. What's she doing here? He made me your alternate. The only person standing in your way is you. How do you know where I live? I have my ways. She's after me. Nobody's after you. Please believe me.

They turned to her husband for answers It is my opinion a sale that size could not have happened. I have teams in the field.

There was no nuclear program need to change the story They made her pay the price So never worked the CIA but his wife is an agency operative I can't tell you anything I have a critical operation in Baghdad my contacts packed and ready to go I've got to get a message to them.

81660," In the year 1990, the New York City authorities declared the wasteland known as the South Bronx to be a high-risk area. There would be no further attempt to restore law and order to that notorious borough. The South Bronx had long since been controlled by gangs with such names as the Riders, Scavengers, Ironmen, Tigers, and Sharks. To venture without permission into the territory of a rival power was to risk war. War with no holds barred. War to the death. Only one man had anything to gain from such a war. Only one man could prevent it. Only one man. 1990. The Bronx Warriors."

Coming up tomorrow, we'll show you what to do with those shampoo bottles with just an inch of shampoo left. Day breaks understaffed, underfunded. Any producer who works there will be publicly ridiculed, overworked, underpaid. Awful. I'll take it. I would like to offer you the position of co-host of Daybreak. After the career that I've had. Is he gonna cook? Is he gonna do fashion segments and gossip? Not my thing. You happen to be a pretentious, fatuous idiot. A fatuous idiot who makes three times what you make. So now is an excellent time for you to take up drinking. What's going on now? Mike is offended by a word in the next story. It's about Easter chicks. You're not saying the word fluffy. Interesting Jerry hired you. No polish. Those bangs. Suppose I don't have standards? Sure you do. When you got your pap smear on air, you wore a silk robe. Okay! Classy touch. It wasn't that bad. How reliable is your alarm clock? You wanna make the ratings worse? That's why you came here? I'm not giving up. Try not to bore the nation into a coma with your dominance crap. Suck it. Mike! No one can do their jobs around here well. Cause you can't be bothered to do yours at all! And we're back. Welcome back to Daybreak. It's only my job. It's not my whole life. Right? You're worse than I am. I was never at home. When I was, I took every phone call. Watching TV out of the corner of my eye. Let me tell you how it all turns out. You end up with nothing. Which is what I had. Until you came along. Take what you want. Steal my pride. Fill me up or cut me down to size. Shut me up when I just scream. I'm only one voice in a million.

They just found out it was a copy like 50 years ago, but they thought it was original for many, many, many centuries. Stop teasing me. Questions about the concept of originality have been discussed throughout history. And look at these cypresses. Look, they're beautiful, they're individual. I mean you never see two cypresses looking the same. Didn't you find it interesting? They say how much they adore their picture, but that it's a copy and they're written somewhere else. My family lives their own lives and I live mine. What kind of philosophy is that? You like it? You drink it. She mistook you for my husband and I didn't correct her. Oh really? Obviously we make a good couple. What do you think? Thank you. You"

What an innancie. He hasn't seen me. I can't cure your husband, but I need total trust. What was your earliest memory? I'm not here to discuss personal matters. Why are you here then? Because I bloody well stammer! Do you know any jokes? Timing isn't my strong suit. Your methods are unorthodox and controversial. Up comes our royal highness. It's actually quite good fun. Yes. Aww. I thought we're feared. It's all peculiar. I take that as a compliment. War with Germany will come. And we will need a king who we can all stand behind. I'm afraid of his own shadow. The nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them. But I can't speak. You could do it. You needn't be governed by fear. It would be like Mad King George the Stammerer. Get up! You can't sit there! Get up! Why not? It's a chair. That is... That is St. Edward's chair. People have carved their names on it. Listen to me! Listen to me! Why should I waste my time listening to you? Because I have a voice! Yes, you do. Your greatest test is yet to come. I'm out of my... What's he say? I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well. Your first wartime speech. Broadcast to the nation and the world. This great time of crisis. However this turns out, I don't know how to thank him. Bertie, you're the bravest man I know. I intend to be a very good queen. To a very great king. Forget everything else and just say it to me."
81847," I could get used to a view like this. Yep, I'm used to it. Guys, I want a castle. Ah, the kingdom. It is beautiful. Clapping, dancing, general merrymaking, not a care in the world. At least for most folks. See that handsome fellow running for his life? That is me. They just can't get my nose right. And that tower? Well, in that tower there lived a girl who was just waiting for her life to begin. We really hit it off. How you doing? Gentlemen that I am, I decided to help her. I'm prepared to offer you a deal. She could not resist me. I didn't want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice. Here comes the smolder. You coming, blondie? And before we knew it, we began to uncover some secrets. I have to know what they are. I mean, this is serious stuff that just might turn this kingdom upside down. Flynn? Rider! Run! Head down. Arms in. Knees apart. Knees apart? Flynn! Look out! Something brought you here. Fate, destiny. A horse. Gossam, your finest table please. Who's that? They don't like me. Who's that? Let's just assume for the moment that everyone in here doesn't like me. Flynn! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Ah! Look out! This is kind of an off day for me. This doesn't normally happen. Go.

You ready for a title shot? I'm not a stepping stone anymore. He's using you. You can't be me. You had a hard enough time being you, and that's why you're in here. We're gonna train. They gotta go. Why am I the problem? I'm his blood. I'm his family. You're crazy. I'm the one fighting. Not you, not you, and not you. This is my shot at the title. I won't get another one after this. Mickey has a chance to do something that I never did, and he needs me. Okay, I'll see you in Mickey's corner. This is your time. I had my time, I blew it. You don't have to. Yo, Mickey, what? Yo, Mickey, what? Yo, Mickey, what? Yo, Mickey, what?"
81949," You lost? Yeah, how do I get back to New York? Don't fall! Hi, Lola! You beautiful. Tomorrow is going to be fantastic. That is, if they even make it to the altar. Cheers to that, huh? Our friends got the nickname the Romantics. Because of our incestuous dating history. This must be really hard for you to watch the love of your life marry the bane of your existence. It's funny, isn't it? Like a love-sick sailor. He's a groom. Grooms get nervous. Of course. Are you okay? Why does everyone keep asking me that? When was the last time you saw him? Saw who? Tom. Dated the man for four years. Nurse, shrink, opponent. We're everything to each other. To their glittering future. Oh, stop it! It's so sad! Nobody knows that I'm out here. Exactly. Nobody knows that you're out here. What's your point? Maybe we can just hang out for a minute. What's wrong? It's going to rain. It's me. What are you doing here? We need to talk.

They're outside my house all the time. The paparazzi. Sometimes they come over the walls. Could you get someone off the property if you needed to? Could you help look after me? Yes. It's me, remember? How did you get this number? You really think I'm gonna let you all free when he's planning? He said you owe him. I don't owe him anything. You're a gangster. You're part of my firm. There are other things I can do and maybe I want to do them. If I fell in love with you, what would you do about it? Everything. You're an accessory now. It's a bit like being married, you know. It's for life. Listen, how about my sister? Everybody knows about your sister. Listen, there are some people after me and they might try and hurt you. You're gone, mate. That will kill everybody. Everyone who belongs to you. I want you out of the country until I settle something. Will you come with me? Will you come with me? Yeah, I will. Something I have to do first. You basically have to allow them. Don't worry about it. You and me could be great. People will remember us. You don't want me to be a gangster.

She'll develop this unconscious need to win my approval and from then on, it's cake. Damn. Why would you want to be a pharmaceutical rep? That pays over 100 grand a year, that's why. Hello, ladies. Hello, gorgeous. Oh, wait. Yep, there's another one. Patient asks. You're an intern. Hi. I'm Dr. Knife. And who are you? Jamie Randall, intern. Well, let's have a look. You're a drug rep. You let me take my shirt off you. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Okay, I apologize. Let me take you out for a cup of coffee. Strong eye contact, implied intimacy. You're good. So what was this mean? Actually, this is me being nice. You have beautiful eyes. That's it? That's the best you got? This isn't about kids. This isn't even about sex for you. This is about finding an hour or two of relief from the pain of being you. And that's fine with me because it's all that one exact same thing. Why don't you have a boyfriend? Just keep it simple. I can do that. Hello? I like hearing the sound of your voice. You like hearing the sound of her voice? Were you abducted by aliens? I hear we're coming out with a new sex drug, Viagra. I want it. This is a revolution. I've already sold 2,000 prescriptions this month alone. It's hard to believe, isn't it? It's hard to believe. You must be swelling with pride! You're a good man. But you're on the fast track. 600 girls dying to discuss sales techniques. Can't do that with me holding you back. She rejected you. That's why you want her! I need you. I'm gonna need you more. I'm sorry. I know. It's so late. Oh my god. Oh my god! Turn around!"
82242, We finally found something else than just plain rocks and dirt. This mountain is like a giant icebox. A storing what? We are standing on biggest burial mound in the world. Something has been carved here. Juuso! Juota! The Christmas tree has been carved! The Christmas tree has been carved! Merry Christmas! What kind of hearts do you make from this? Big and fucking big!

82459," I'm about to embark on a great adventure. I intend to see Papa's killer hanged. They tell me you're a man with true grit. What's your name, girl? My name is Maddie Ross. In the darkness, as black as the sea. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. And I cried, oh Lord. I shall fear no one. Take my hand. Let me stand, where no one stands. So long. I will avenge Papa's death."
82461," I promise you that if I ever got any information about your dad, I'd tell you first, right? I was paged last night. Came from your dad's office at the arcade. So? So? The number's been disconnected for 20 years. Two nights before he disappeared, he came to my house. He said he was about to change everything. Science, medicine, religion. He wouldn't have left that, Sam. He wouldn't have left you. Alan, you're acting like I'm gonna find him sitting there working. Just, hey kiddo, lost track of time. Might be something. Dad? Sam? Long time. You have no idea. Whoa."
82499," We're here. You know, I might have to go back on what I said about finally seeing your place tonight. There's no pressure. It should feel right. Why are you moving away? I don't want to give you room to think and decide. This girl's plan is meet a guy, love, have a baby. But I don't know if I have what it takes for everybody's regular plan. Son, I have some disturbing news. What? I'll wait till you get here. Tell me, please, it would be nice to get one piece of bad news without someone studying my face to see how I'm taking it. They are going to indict you. George? How are you? Good to see you. Yeah. George, this is my boyfriend, Matty. Nice to meet you. Who is he? You didn't even say hello. Yeah, I think you ought to check with me before you invite some guy over so I'm a little too pissed off to just say hello. I think I screwed up. Not from my perspective. Axie? No, I just have to figure out where I'm going. Let me ask you something. How do you know when you're in love? Anyone? I got a way. I figure I'm in love with somebody when I wear a condom with the other girls. Holy crap, I'm in love. What sort of trouble are you in, George? I'm currently unemployed. I'll soon run out of money and I'm the target of a federal investigation. You're a real chick magnet, aren't you? Son, we're in a rapidly evolving situation. Don't tell me. George, are you going to make me literally run from bad news? You do not have the luxury of not... To people who make toasts. I just touched your leg. I know. I wrote something else that I want to say to you. I went nuts when you left. I broke a lamp. Okay, read me the thing. That was the thing. You"

Because I have faith, courage, enthusiasm. Good. Hey, you want to take a guess at what I shot at the club this morning? What happened? Somebody died? What's going on? The company's consolidating divisions. Difficult decisions had to be made in areas where redundancies surface. You firing me? Three thousand jobs. They were good people Jim. Hell, it's a business. Not a charity. I've always told you what I thought right or wrong and this is wrong. I'm late for a meeting. You got one kid in college, another one going in the fall. I won't go back to a factory floor. I'll take an AK-47 to this place first. Mr. Walker, can I speak to you for a moment? I just got thrown off the course of the club. You playing golf? Digging your Porsche details? I need to look successful. Hi, Sally. Thanks for not returning any of my phone calls. If you do, I'll be happy to help you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

If you do return my call, I would love to know why you fired me without any notice. You cowardly witch. See? Wonder why she never calls you back. It feels good though. Would you do the honors? Dear God, please help my dad find a job so he won't be unhappy all the time. Okay. You know, things get tough. You can always use some extra help this winter. Easy work, huh, Bobby? Pretty much like moving car supports from the inbox to the outbox. I hate your brother. We could get through it. I'm a 37 year old unemployed loser. You have Drew and Carson and me. You have me. We can make something here. Start out with a crazy plan. Start slow, see if it will grow. You in? You should take that job. You're a terrible carver. I will win. Why? Because I have faith, courage, enthusiasm. I will win!"
82608," You asking me out? I'll just sit there, I won't even talk. She's smart, funny, when she's ravioli with a spoon. You're like, huh? Keenan, come here, quick! What? Oh, I had hair, man. It's about a part of me getting smaller. The important part. Give me a break, man. You're not 13. Screw you, maybe I caught something. Your friend here has an extra chromosome. Keenan, look! Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with him? This is your opheliac. It's so cool, it's disgusting. Man, it's just weird, two guys hanging out, one turning into a girl. I'm not doing it. I don't give a shit what she says, I can control this. You're gonna try to keep yourself from getting turned on? Yeah. Come on, Luke, you get turned on by two scoops of ice cream. Where has it been hiding round the corner, around the world? Would you rather she was attracted to me? Would you? This is nuts, I am supposed to be a guy. There's no supposed to be anything, you just are. Well, the thing is, sometimes our desires can conflict with our desires. No way I'm gonna ask for that. Well, you have to. Come on, where are your nads, man? Well, get him back. I make out with a girl, I start turning into one. You gotta admit, that's a little weird."

82934," We are going to win. Quit making national heroes out of those who steal secrets and publish them in the newspaper. The hundreds of thousands we were killing was unjustified homicide, and I couldn't see the difference between that and murder. Murder had to be stopped. This weekend, portions of a highly classified Pentagon document came to light for all the world to see, brought cries of outrage from Washington. We gotta get this son of a bitch. Yes, Kennedy did send troops in violation of the Geneva Accord. Johnson did start the buildup before he said he was going to. These guys were lying through their teeth when they were talking to us, and here it is in black and white, there's no way of denying it. The Times building is encircled by armed guards. We are printing tomorrow a top secret government document. A name has now come out as the possible source of the Times Pentagon documents. It is that of Daniel Ellsberg, the top policy analyst for the Defense and State Department. I am prepared to answer to all the consequences of these decisions. Henry Kissinger said that Daniel Ellsberg was the most dangerous man in America, and he had to be stopped. The study was 47 volumes, 7,000 pages. It would take me months of Xeroxing. We have dropped another 200,000 tons of bombs on end of China. That's 10 Hiroshima's. One Hiroshima a week. What has remained significant about the release of the Pentagon papers is the decision by a public official to give priority to conscience as compared to career. Daniel Ellsberg, whatever his intentions, gave aid and comfort to the enemy. It was a crime from the start, carried out by four presidents, and now a fifth president was doing the same. I'm not going to be part of this system of lying anymore. It wasn't that we were on the wrong side. We were the wrong side."

83134," What? What? What? Oh! This place is so creepy. Have you ever seen anything like that in your life? Just your average college girl. Why don't you go over there and talk to her? Talk to her? You girls, uh... gone camping? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Did you see the way those guys looked? We are in hillbilly country now, boys! Squeal like a beast! Yeah! Oh my god. I cannot believe that I am standing in my own vacation home. Do you guys want to hear a scary story? Chuck, no, man! This story happened right in these very woods. It was 20 years ago today.

I saw your friend out there. He must be allergic to bees or something because he was running like a bat out of hell. Run! Run for your life! They killed him, man. They left his body here as a message. He's making her dig her own grave. It's not work for a pretty girl like you. I hear from the farm. Is it a help out or get out? They're gonna kill her. It's us against them. Where did you come from? This is a god-team suicide pact. These kids are coming out here and they're killing themselves all over the woods. Oh my god, that makes so much sense. It's all a game! Help! Go to the police? Everyone's doing some chores around the house when kids start killing themselves all over my property. Well, that's what happened, Tucker. He's gonna walk it off. I was evil walking right now. What the hell is wrong with you kids? What is the matter with us? I've never stood so close to pure evil before. I've got 10 to 12 beers. They're on ice right now, man. They're yours. Uh, guys? Maybe we should help him. You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison. You're crazy. Time to die, freak!"

Harry Nielsen, either they get it right away or they have no idea. Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the morning comes. What if I'm late, got a big day, gotta get home before the sun comes up. I was dialing a telephone, I got a busy signal and it was like beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. And it just wrote it on the phone. One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do. He just came on the scene, you know blasted onto the scene and he just started influencing people. I'm sure he influenced the Beatles as much as the Beatles influenced him. Nielsen's my favorite. The Beatles endorsed Harry. He's the most interesting to the world and he says listen to this man. I thought to myself this song really has the potential to be like a little animated cartoon. So I said why don't you try using different voices. Think of the doctors and now let me get this straight.

83827," Meanwhile, back in Marwanko, the SS took me, it tied me up, then it started to cut me. I put a scar down my face because this side was damaged in real life. Mark Hogan Kemp was in a bar, and a group of five individuals beat him senseless and did some pretty bad damage to his brain. When the teenagers kicked my head to pieces, they wiped all memory of everything. What's the first thing I get to work on? That's my imagination. Everything's real. The slide on the 45, the clip even comes out. I'm sorry. Everybody has a dream. Everybody wishes they had a double, that they could do things that they could never do.

If you go back 500 years, not much happens in a century. Now a lot happens in six months. Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster. It's going to continue and in about 40 years it's going to be moving so fast, the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it unless you enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we're creating. This guy is freaky. He says computers will have consciousness in just 25 years. As we get to the 2030s you're not going to be able to tell a clear difference between human and machine intelligence. He's an award-winning scientist and engineer, a millionaire several times over because of his inventions. Ray Kurzweil. These inventions may end up causing the worst war that humanity's ever had. Corporations and governments and societies will be created and destroyed on the back of the technology that this book describes. Inventor Ray Kurzweil thinks that one day humans may be able to live forever. I want to live as long as I can. I don't want to die. If following Ray's regiment would put that day off, I'm very willing to do that. I knew there was a reason I was keeping all this stuff and he kept all this stuff. I do plan to bring back my father. It's going to scare a lot of people. The world is changing far too fast. Nothing like this has ever happened to homo sapiens before. These ideas are going to ultimately change the world. We didn't stay on the ground, we didn't stay on the planet, and we didn't stay with the limitations of our biology. I think Ray is performing the service of a prophet. That's wrong. He has used the gift that he was given for the betterment of humankind. That's what I know. There will be the universe waking up."

85016," About 15 buildings here have been abandoned for quite some time. They did a lot of searching for the kids here. Specifically for Jennifer and I believe Hollyann. Growing up on Staten Island, Barbara and I had often heard the legend of Cropsey. You're supposed to have a hook and an axe. And a knife about this big. Cropsey was the escaped mental patient who lived in the tunnels beneath the old abandoned Willowbrook mental institution. Who would come out late at night, snatch children off the streets. I would have never guessed it were the amount of weirdos living on Staten Island. It might be somebody on your block. It might be somebody you work with. You know, here's this guy going around picking off these kids. I can imagine how other parents, even if your kid's gone for an hour, I can imagine how they must feel. You know, that's probably one of the last things that you ever think about, that somebody would take your daughter. Seemed like everywhere I went, there were people out in the woods looking for that little girl. It's no question if we were going to find her. We definitely were going to find her. She thinks we're picking at dead children's bones. We just want closure on her. Is that so? What the fuck was that? I heard something. Look down there. Look down there. Look down there. They're on the hallway. It's scary because we have a boogie man living on Staten Island all those years. That image forced a lot of people to say, that is the killer. There's no reason for him to exist anywhere else, you know, other than jail. We had the same questions that you were asking me. Why did he do this? What set him on it? It's sort of like putting a puzzle together. You know, he likes to be the center of attention, the keeper of the secrets. So I think it'd be great if you could speak for your audience. What if we just do audio? I will not go on you. Do you think they're all around us? Yeah. Oh my God. I think he's possessed. I really think that he is demonized and possessed."

Now on this sunny morning, Pooh, who was a bear of very little brain, tried very hard to think of something. Think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think. And while he was thinking, all of a sudden... Hello, Pooh! I'm Tigger! T-I-double-guh-er! That spells Tigger! Yeah, I know. You've bounced me before. Well, I gotta go now. I got a lot of bouncing to do. T-T-F-N! Ta-ta for now! Well, there goes Tigger, always bouncing in on his friends when they least expect him. Oh, hello, Piglet! I'm Tigger! Oh, Tigger! You scared me! Oh, shucks! That was just one of my little bounces. It was? Oh, thank you, Tigger. Oh, yeah. I'm saving my best bounce for old long ears. Ta-ta!

Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Just look at my beautiful garden. Yuck. Messy, isn't it? Oh, why don't you ever stop bouncing? Why? That's what Tiggers do best! The wonderful thing about Tiggers is Tiggers are wonderful things. Their tops are made out of rubber, their bottoms are made out of springs. They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun. But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the only one. I'm the only one! Order! Order, please! Now, I say, Tigger's getting so bouncy nowadays that it's time we taught him a lesson. No matter how much we like him, you can't deny he just bounces too much. Uh, excuse me, Rabbit, but perhaps if we could think of a way of unbouncing Tigger, it would be a very good idea, huh? So Tigger and Rule went farther into the Hundred Acre Wood looking for something that Tiggers do best. I bet you could climb trees, huh, Tigger? Climb trees? That's what Tiggers do best! Only Tiggers don't climb trees, they bounce them! Come on, let's go! I almost bounced clear out of the book! Some bouncing, huh? Say, how did this tree get so high? Hello! Hey, Tigger, it's Pooh and Piglet. Pooh! Piglet! Why, it's only Tigger and Rule. Come on. Hello, Rule! Hey, what are you and Tigger doing up there? I'm all right, but Tigger's stuck! Help somebody, please! Get Christopher Robin! But it wasn't too long before word got back to Christopher Robin and the others that Tigger was in trouble. Hello, Pooh. Hello, Piglet. What's up? Tigger and Rule are up. Well, just have to get them down somehow. Down? Down? Do we have to? Come on, everyone. Let's hold a corner of my coat. Your first rule, jump! Try not to fall too fast, dear. Oh, thank goodness! Gee, that was fun! Come on, Tigger, it doesn't hurt, jump! Jump? Tiggers don't jump, they bounce! You can climb down, Tigger! But Tiggers can't climb down because their tails get in the way. Hooray! That settles it. If he won't jump and he can't climb down, then we'll just have to leave him up there forever. Forever? If I ever get out of this, I promise never to bounce again. Never! I heard that, Tigger. He promised. Did you hear him promise? I heard him. I heard him. You heard him, didn't you? Didn't you? Well, Tigger, your bouncing really got you into trouble this time. Say, who are you? I'm the narrator. Oh, well, please for goodness sakes narrate me down from here. Very well. Hold on tight. You can let go now, Tigger. Never! But Tigger, look for yourself. You're perfectly safe. When did I tell you, Tigger? Come on. There we go. Oh, good old terra firma. I'm so happy. I feel like bouncing. You promised. You promised. Oh, I did, didn't I? You mean I can't ever bounce again? Never! Never? Christopher Wobbins, I like the old bouncy Tigger best. So do I, Rue. I do, too. Me, too. Of course, we all do. Don't you agree, Rabbit? Oh, all right. I guess I like the old Tigger better. You mean I can have my bounce back? Come on, Rabbit. Let's you and me bounce. Oh, good heavens. Let me bounce? Sure. Come on. Try it. It makes you feel just great. Well, say, it does. Well, come on, everybody. Bounce. Come on, bounce. The wonderful thing about Tiggers is Tiggers are wonderful things. Their tops are made out of rubber. Their bottoms are made out of springs.

This is one of the rare times anyone is allowed inside the cave. This may be the only and last opportunity to film inside. The first time I entered a cave it was so powerful. Every night I was dreaming of lions. There are no barriers between the world where we are and the world of the spirits. A wall can talk to us. After five days I decided not to go back in the cave because it was an emotional shock. These images are memories of long forgotten dreams. Will we ever be able to understand the vision of the artists across such an abyss of time? Silence please. We're going to listen to the cave and perhaps we can even hear our own heartbeat.

No. Tror du Michael må lage gas etter første forsøk? Tror du det? Har det på norsk? Det er ingen her som tror på Gud eller Jesus. Nei, det er ingen som... De gir det opp til Kristmasbron.

Welcome back, Captain Stevens. Where am I? You are inside the source code. What is the source code? It's a computer program, Captain. The source code enables you to cross over into another man's identity in the last eight minutes of his life. At 748 this morning, a bomb exploded on a train outside of Chicago, killing everyone on board. A man named Sean Fentress was on that train. He is now you. Think, Captain, remember back. Who bombed the train? I don't know who bombed the train. Then try again. Wait, no. So, what do you think? It's the same train, but it's different. We've been informed there will be another attack in six hours. If you find the bomber, the next attack can be prevented. Concentrate on the passengers in your car. Look for ones who seem nervous. As always, you will have eight minutes. Eight minutes, and then I blow up again. What would you do if you knew you had less than eight minutes to live? I'd make those seconds count. I want to go back in. I'm going to save her. You can't. It doesn't work that way. Christina is dead. She doesn't have to be. You cannot alter this reality while inside the source code.

85612," Mit der Entdeckung des Kochens begann die Entwicklung vom Steinzeitmenschen zum Homo sapiens. Kochen ist die Mutter der Philosophie, der Chemie, der Physik. Kochen ist Dichtung, Transformation, Schöpfung. Wenn ich nicht kochte, beobachtete ich Frauen. Was sind Sie? Ladendetektiv? Ich koche. Dafür sitzen Sie aber ganz schön oft hier rum und glotzen Frauen an. Du kannst dir nicht vorstellen, was diese Brille mit mir gemacht hat. Sie hat mich einfach überwältigt. Dieser dicke Koch ist ein Genie. Wie bist du auf sowas für verrückt geworden? Ich stand an der Brigitte. Das ist für dich. Dann das auch an der Brigitte. Ich bin immer weggelaufen, mein ganzes Leben lang. Aber in diesem Moment hatte ich beschlossen, für alle Zeiten damit aufzuhören. Ich kann schon wieder. Ich spreche dich um! Ich will meine Familie überhalten. Also heiße ich Eden wie der Garten. Sie haben noch das offene Herz. Darf ich... Darf ich Ihnen... Auch ein kleines Erdbeer kaputt machen."

85774," I came to Europe to compete for the first time. It was pure driving. It was real racing. I'm dead. That makes me happy. Oh my goodness! This is fantastic! I think we are watching the arrival of Ayrton Senna, a truly staggering talent. He'll be ranked among the all-time greats. How do you feel about being world champion? It's not a bad feeling at all, is it? Ayrton has a small problem. He thinks that he can't kill himself. And I think that's very dangerous. We are competing to win. And if you no longer go for a gap, you're no longer a racing driver. Now Alphos takes the lead. Senna is trying to go through all the inside. It's a gap! I was treated like a criminal. The best decision is my decision. I can't stand this. Walking away from the dark forces just doesn't become an option. I was not going to give up. So have any of your girlfriends ever asked you to go faster? Ja. There was an energy, a force, a spirit. It was electrifying. It was the last time either of them would be on the podium. Ayrton ran out of luck. There is a lot to go, a lot to learn, a lot to do. But I have plenty of time. Pure driving. New racing. That makes me happy."

Or shooting dope from dirty needles in a bus stop. And if you're successful, you'll make money selling junk to crackheads. And you won't think twice about killing someone's wife.

86290," Plenty of people say he is the best American comedian the country has ever produced. His influence lives on. I'm going to share with you a vision that I have, because I love you. Get out! Get out! Take her out! Hey buddy, we're Christians, we don't like what you say. I said then forgive me. Please welcome Bill Hicks. He was just completely unique, like he was from somewhere else. Bill was just like a new breed of person. He was going to be the comic that shook people up. We had this Iraq war thing happen. First of all, this needs to be said, there never was a war. How can you say that Bill? A war is when two armies are fighting. Bill is searching for something to like take his comedy to other levels. How about a positive LST story? Wouldn't that be newsworthy? Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There's no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather. My voice was not heard, the questions were not asked that I wanted to see asked. Bill had this desperate desire to get mainstream America to see his point of view. And what you find out is they don't want you to talk about ideas on TV. It's not enough just to make jokes about it, you have to kick over some tables. That's what being a patriot means, is that you question the powers. You're right, you're right, not those fuckers who want to tell you how to think, you're fucking right. That's a powerful idea when you see somebody that believes so much in that kind of freedom. By the way, if anyone here is in advertising or marketing, kill yourself. Thank you, thank you."

So, some of the material... none of it is topical so I don't think it's very dated, but it's a little ripe. I think. I'm gonna be back afterwards for your questions. So, there's no reason for me to be here right now. Thank you for coming and supporting the film. It's gonna be on Epix, which is a new channel that I didn't know existed until they bought this. And now it's gonna be on Epix September 17th. It'll start airing on Epix. You can go to epix.something. I don't think it's dot org or dot gov. Probably dot com. You can also download it and watch it there. So, just let people know that because I was on The Tonight Show and I didn't even mention that it's on Epix and they're a little... I think they're a little mad. They should be because I've done nothing else to promote it on their network, which nobody even knows is there. It's like channel 750 and a half.

89085," We should never forget how young they were. Thirty years ago, these three dared to confront an unimaginable evil. Stefan Gold was the youngest unit commander in Mossad. David Peretz had his 29th birthday while on the mission. Rachel Singer was only 25 when she crossed through the checkpoint into Soviet controlled East Berlin. So first time in the field. Good, that's good. Welcome to the mission. Their assignment had been to capture the surgeon of Birkenau, a man whose sadistic experiments left thousands disfigured or dead. It's a brave thing you're doing. I'm not brave, I'm terrified. We take him back alive. We'll show the world what he did. You're trembling. I think you're the one that is afraid, David. Afraid of the monster. We followed. Oh, God. Only four people know what happened here. No matter what, the truth stays in this room between us. What if we could go back? Would it be different? We can't go back. We have to deal."
89090," I've said many times that we all get dressed for Bill. Okay. This is Bill Cunningham on the street this week. There's no reason to be doom and gloom and think that fashion is finished. The best fashion show is definitely on the street. Always has been and always will be. We're all blank canvases when we get up in the morning and we paint ourselves. Street style emerged at the same point that Bill got a camera. He's been documenting me since I was a kid and it's one snap, two snaps, or he ignores you, which is death. Bill's fingerprints are all over everything he does because he's never, ever, ever sold out one inch of anything. Put her here and put her over here. Put it on, stop your antics. Put it up there. Damn you kids. I have the feeling that he doesn't sit down and talk to people too much. I have no idea about his private life. I have no idea if he's lonely. I once went to his studio. Have you been there? This is my clothes closet. Does he still sleep on the cabinets? Who the hell wants a kitchen and a bathroom? You see, if you don't take money, they can't tell you what to do. That's the key to the whole thing. New York society becomes harder and harder to define. Bill is a true egalitarian. However, that doesn't mean he isn't aware of cultural vision and hierarchies. He just treats it all the same. I'm not interested in celebrities with their free dresses. I'm interested in clothes. I would come into a place and he would say, Oh, thank God you're here. Everybody here looks so boring. If we all went out looking like slob like me, it would be a pretty dreary world. The wider world that perceives fashion as a frivolity that should be done away with, the point is that fashion, it's the armor to survive the reality of everyday life. I don't think you could do away with it. It would be like doing away with civilization. That's what I think. I'll be your mirror. I'll be your mirror. I'll be your mirror."

89260," I thought, wouldn't it be exciting to communicate with a chimp and find out what it was thinking? So why not teach him sign language? And that's essentially why I started Project Nim. I know nothing about chimpanzees. Herb wanted me to take Nim into my home as if he were a child. The fact that we could share language with an animal seemed very radical at that time. There was no family discussion. It was just, oh, we're having a chimp. We're going to teach him sign language. Nobody in the house really was fluent in sign language. Everything was about treating him like a human being. He liked alcohol. He loved driving fast in cars. I breastfed him for a couple of months. It seemed completely natural. I couldn't believe it. It was the 70s. Herb wanted a schedule and charted progress. I didn't supply that. There was utter chaos. There were no journals. There were no logbooks. This was a scientific project. I had an implicit faith that Nim would learn signs. I just mapped out a teaching plan for Nim and I did it. Nim was learning signs rapidly. They're going up, up, up, up, up. I could see I was succeeding. There was all this excitement and hype about the project. I had a relationship with a chimpanzee and I had conversations with an end species. Nim, going from being this meek little huggable toy to a robust young chimpanzee. He's going to be big. Five to six times the strength of a man. He's got fangs. This is 37 stitches. In that sense, he was becoming more chimp-like. It didn't seem to be a cause for alarm. I had never regarded him as a child. I regarded him as a scientific project. Nobody keeps a chimp for more than five years. That's the best time of my life. I've never had such a good time, except maybe at a Grateful Day show. The reality of it is it's not a doll, it's not a toy, it's not a human, it's a chimp."

There you've been dumped because it all goes on a mental breakdown. Now you've been dumped because it all goes on a mental holiday together. Two weeks of sun, sea, booze, ninge, fanny and sex.

A man was murdered overnight on Chicago's South Side. Police say it happened to execution stop. I'm fed up. 124 people have been killed. Each and every one of you all can be due right here. There are three bullet holes in his home. Fire. We got a responsibility to bring up our community to be vibrant. He died last Friday, shot in the back as he tried to shoot. My brothers, cease the fire. Call the truth. The violence of the Rebters had one goal in mind, to save a life. And we need people to step up to this table and go over and beyond. We got over 500 years of prison time at this table. That's a lot of wisdom. If I fall short... After my life, I was in prison. That's why I do what I do now. I think I just stay busy, just trying to forget about some of the things that I've done. I used to be in jail, kicking off rides, and just gang banging. Let's just correct this.

I wonder if it can be good for her, my dear, to read quite so many novels. Oh, why ever not? What could be a more innocent or harmless pastime for a young girl than reading? Quite the young lady, isn't she, Mr. Allen? Mr. and Mrs. Allen come with an invitation, Catherine. We would like you to accompany us to Bath for a time. For when a young lady is to be a heroine, something must and will happen to throw adventure in her way. There are so many people. I wonder who they can be and what their stories are. Cindy, hang on.

It's just like what we read about. Let's just say that all houses have their secrets and Northanger is no exception. What do you think? I don't think the real world is full of murders and abductions and ghosts with clanking chains and seductions and everything. Perhaps not quite so many murders and abductions.

89881," You You Clark where have you been and what are you doing in that outfit? You You Superman and the mole men this is a good place to start Since debuting in action comics number one in 1938 Superman's popularity soared He quickly appeared in newspaper comic strips radio programs animated cartoons and serial adventures By 1951 a television series adventures of Superman was planned the first story shot was released to movie screens It was to be the first theatrically released feature film based on the character of Superman After filming rap 24 additional half-hour episodes were filmed The film was 58 minutes long and was later recut as a two-part episode for the television series Retitled the unknown people it was shot in 12 days on the studio backlot George Reeves makes his debut appearances Clark Kent and Superman. He would become known as Superman for a generation of fans Phyllis Coates stars as Lois Lane. She would play Lois only for the first season of the television series then departed the role Despite its B-level budget the film is an entertaining morality tale There's only one person who can handle this job and that's Superman The story begins as Clark and Lois arrive at the small town of Silsbee to report on the world's deepest oil well However, it soon discovered the well has created an opening to the underground world of the mole men Panic soon envelopes the citizens who instinctively form a mob with sites to kill the monsters Fortunately Superman is there to handle the situation and end the conflict peacefully Superman's role is essentially one that promotes tolerance and shows the dangers of what irrational fear can do Being made in the time of the Cold War environment and the Red Scare hysteria the message was very topical and it still is relevant today The moral lesson is one that suits the Superman character and one that seems he would be a champion for The one scene that really encapsulates this lesson is where the little girl is simply playing with the two mole men until her mother discovers them and lets out a frightened scream. It's very similar to the classic Frankenstein scene of the monster and the little girl The special effects are rather cheap, but there is a certain charm to them Knowing the filmmakers had a limited budget to work with there is sincerity to how they tried to tell their story with the best They had to work with There are some creative techniques they used My personal favorite is the shot filming down from a boom crane and having it speed down the street to simulate Superman's flying The makeup on the mole men themselves is pretty silly looking they don't really look very mole like to me But after a while, I just got used to them. I Even started to feel bad for the one goofy little guy when he's running for his life. I Thought you might be ready to talk now George Reeves is Clark Kent is more forceful than you would expect He's not as mild mannered and mousy as other interpretations. What are you hiding hiding? Well, you give the impression you're leading a Double life really Superman has a bit more aggressive edge to him, too He's more than ready to throw someone around if they're not willing to listen You saved my life that's more than you deserve I thought that line of dialogue was a bit unsuperman like As the television series went on Reeves is Superman would become a little more relaxed So population 1430 home of the world's deepest oil well big deal Phyllis coats is a pretty darn good Lois Lane She's got enough abrasiveness to make you think she's this tough-as-nails reporter and she's attractive to look at There goes a young man with courage. Well, I wish I could say the same for you I liked how she was more than willing to put Clark in his place and isn't very subtle about it Plus it was somewhat refreshing to see a Lois not get weak need at the sight of Superman Overall, it's not a bad little film. It's a respectable debut of the superhero film genre I can imagine little kids watching this in 1951 and being mesmerized by it and wanting more Superman adventures Watching it now. It might look quaint and simple, but it is still enjoyable Say you reckon that Superman fella really can fly like they say"

I think I can handle this part myself. According to the statement, the light was green when the bus passed through the intersection? Yes. So you're saying she walked against the light? I know you feel a sense of responsibility about what happened, but you can't not do your homework and you can't throw away your scholarship because of it. The bus driver probably has a family to support. Do you remember me from the bus accident? It's a tragedy. You cannot bring her back. I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened. But you already talked to them. I know that, but I lied. You're gonna go home and you're gonna do your homework and I'm gonna lose my job. And who's gonna take care of my family? You? I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who I am or what's going on inside me. I feel like you and I used to relate to each other really well. I feel so bad about what happened and I'm trying so hard to do something about it. The worlds of one would leave me alive and yet you will weep and know why it is Margaret you mourn for."

I may have my own private island in Belize, but deep down I'm just in the story of boy like Josh here. That's right, PS 104. Go Lions. Just an hour ago, the tower's richest resident was released into federal custody under house arrest here at his penthouse apartment. Several years ago, he was asked to manage all of your pensions.

We made bail. How come you bailed me out? I don't even know your name. You don't remember Mrs. Salzburg? We used to get dropped off at her apartment every morning for daycare. Come on, heavyset German woman, short goatee. You the little seizure boy that's having them seizures all the time. No. You would have seizures on a regular basis and all the kids would be crying and your eyes rolling back and the foam coming out. It was very scary. Asthma doesn't cause seizures. Why'd you bail me out? Because I have a job. Oh, little seizure boy won't try to rob somebody, huh? What you trying to steal? $20 million. Robbery can change very quickly.

Mr. Tolson, I need someone who I can trust. I want you to be my number two man. You understand? I need you.

90863," Go ahead, George, go on and fly away, babe. Just be free. He was clearly an innovator. He was cocky, had a great haircut. We didn't really have that much money, we only just really had enough to feed ourselves. I think with George, it wasn't his ambition to be in the Beatles for his whole life. You see your pictures and read articles about George Harrison, you don't realize that it's actually about yourself. It's like a marriage, you love each other but you're getting fed up. We knew that he was peaking. George liked to surround himself with people that were good at something. He'd mortgaged his house to put up the money for this movie because he wanted to see it, which is still the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket. Well, we've got to do something, you know, with our lives. He comes in to me because he'd been to India again, he said, I've got this song. I think we shared a lot of tastes, cars and clothes and women, obviously. I was being treated like the Messiah or something. Mr. Chapman shot John Lennon. You know, if someone said you can have everything in five lifetimes or you can have a really intense one, he would have said, give me the one, I'm not coming back here. People always say I'm the Beatle who changed the most, but really that's what I see life is about. You have to change."

This is how I'll remember you. Pink cheeks. Heart beat. I think I'd be used to telling you goodbye by now. Last night was the best night of my existence. It's impossible. Whoa. The fetus isn't compatible with your body. It's too strong and fast growing. It's crushing you from the inside out. Your heart will give out before you can deliver. You did this.

Forget Hollywood. Let it all go. First love is such sweet despair, Colin. Shall I be your wife? Who? Marilyn."
91199," When I was writing the script, some people were like, is anybody going to want to watch this who isn't gay? Because you are talking a lot about being gay and about gay issues and gay struggles. And my argument was, in some strange way, the more precise you become about an experience, the more universal, weirdly, it actually becomes. And so I was never really scared about that. I just kind of thought, you know, if you just watch these people, yes, they're talking about these things. But underneath that, they are just trying to connect and they want the same things and they're looking for intimacy and they're trying to work out what they want from the world. I want it to be challenging to both a gay and straight audience. I think that was always my ambition. And it's quite a tricky balance to get right. You want to reflect a gay experience, but you obviously can't reflect everybody's gay experience. I'm really just reflecting these two people's gay experience, and I suppose mine."

I'm not sure. I don't know. Are you there? What do you miss about him? I miss his voice. I miss his voice telling me he loves me. Me too. After he died, I found this key in my dad's closet. How can I find the lock that it fits? What's it got to do with my dad? I told you I didn't know anything about your father. Finding what this key fits would be an error. He must have wanted me to find something. What is it open? So many people enter and leave your life. Dad said you can't be afraid. Sometimes we have to face our fears. I love you. I'm right here if you need me."

Of course we can handle it. Something's wrong here. What is this, Stace? I just wish it was more like a normal job. Now it's weird. This might even be some kind of test.

91688," Well, I guess my story starts right around here. Not so long ago, Carl was a lost soul. A dead head. Now he is a transformed man. We're both authors of best-selling books. What if we co-authored one about our opposing worldviews? Could bring a lot of non-believers to Christ. Or believers to reason. Without God, it's to stop me from killing poor Carl here. The collaboration begins. I just got word that late last night, Professor Blaylock was the victim of an attempted suicide. Holy crap! The church has a third millennium pastor. You gotta come with me. Just smile and pretend nothing's wrong. What's going on, Jerry? Pastor Dan told me everything. He did? Just admit when you did. Me? What? Yeah, you shot that guy and tried to make him look like a suicide. Jerry, help me, Carl. I've gotten out of a tower. Dan shot the professor. I know Dan wouldn't do a thing like that. I was there. I wanted him to do it with my own eyes. You're off on some kind of acid flashback. Okay. This incident has sent Carl into a very dark place. Tell me, did he have any family history? Like genealogy. Carl may or may not be demonically possessed. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? You're being controlled by evil. We're friends, man. I'd let you run the grill at my barbecue. Nice performance. The pastor shot that professor. I am armed and dangerous! I have a sword of the spirit! Mom! It is the word of God! I get it now. I get it. I am the anointed servant of God! I'm not the guy. You got the wrong guy. I even got a title. Let's play together. Come on."
91869," When I was nine years old, it was just a dream that I had. Wow, I wish that I could work with the Muppets. Hi, this is Kevin Clash from Sesame Street. How are you? Kevin is most comfortable when he is Elmo. Thank you for coming. Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss. Elmo's happy now. Hi! So many kids went out and built their own puppets. It was in high school. He had guys that would pick on him, said he was playing with dolls. He faced a lot of opposition, but he just stuck with his dream. If I could have climbed on the set of Sesame Street, I would have tried. And I thought, who is creating this? Hello there, my name is Jim Henson and I'm a puppeteer. I wanted to see everything that Jim was doing. This is who I would like to be. He jumped from high school right to New York. Richard Hunt was totally fed up with his character. He tossed it in Kevin's lap. What am I going to do with him? And I said, hello, this is Elmo. Fine, give it a try. And then I got it. I knew that Elmo should represent love. I didn't know that this was going to happen with Elmo. It's very difficult to make a piece of fabric react like a human being would. But Kevin, oh my gosh, he's brilliant. Everybody wanted Elmo, Elmo, Elmo, Elmo. I started traveling so much. I'd be in Japan, China, South Africa. There needed to be an additional performer. And Kevin was like, no, I can do it. That's when I knew that this was bigger than me. When a puppet is true and good and meaningful, it's the soul of the puppeteer that you're seeing. The thing that people love about Elmo is he needs them. I attribute that to Kevin because of his embodiment of his character. He really does exemplify what Jim Henson began with, something that touched everyone. If everybody else your age is doing something very different to what you're doing, there's always going to be someone saying that you might not succeed, you might not make any money with that. All of those things will go away if you really focus on what makes you happy."

94953," You ready for your meeting? Yep. Knock him dead, alright? I'll call you later. You know what I want to do? I want to take off that robe. Why are you not at work, George? Oh, I got told. I forgot fired. As soon as we can get back on our feet, we'll come back to New York. But right now, my brother is in the hospital. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. I'm going to go get him. You know what, you can go, I can do it. We're not going to rush you to New York. But right now, my brother is offering me a job and Atlanta is the best place for us to be. Ahhh. Hey, there he is. My homeless brother, where's your cardboard box? I'm Linda. Oh my God. Your body is ridiculous. Rick, I think you're making everybody uncomfortable. Oh, everybody knows what I mean. Here you go, simple dad entry. You want me to enter this data? Are you questioning me? Don't question me. Am I serious? You're fired. You're rehired. Consider that a warning shot. Let's get the hell out of here. All right. I cannot be in this car anymore. I'll leave you in bed and breakfast. You're looking for the B&B? There's another half mile. You can't miss it. Leave? Yeah. Oh, no, no. Oh, my God, it's coming out. He wants to make a suit out of our skin. You guys okay? We'll take care of you. My name's Wayne, by the way. I'm a nudist. Oh, yes, we noticed your penis earlier. Touche! All these people live here. This is a commune. We're from an intentional community. We're not a bunch of hippies sitting around playing guitar. Wrap your fingers around the base of it. Work the shaft down to the tip. And then flick the tip. What? Flick the tip. Flick the tip. Welcome to the Elysium community! It's not like we're signing a lease. We'll give it a month. Two weeks. Oh, George. I like you. I like you, too, Eva. We should make love sometime. How'd you and Linda feel about that? Oh... This place is incredible. I actually feel like I'm a part of something that's real. What is this? Ayahuasca tea. Reeks like a cat butt. It has hallucinogenic properties. I can fly! You can't fly! I believe I can fly! If you're gonna get literal with an R. Kelly song, let the dude trapped in the closet! So, I'm light on your bio. You know, man, is it cool if maybe we talk about this later? Take your time."
94959," This is from C. Merton, Huntington Beach, California. What informs your creative process in the writing slash pre-production phase, and how long do you think you let an idea kernel gestate before diving in? To wit, do you like to freely flow outward and then go back and edit, or do you like to surround yourself with research as you go along? I guess probably freely flow. I think just from my perspective, there's not so much research comparatively to other filmmakers. I've seen their process where they're often really gathering a lot of visual imagery and stuff, but Wes always likes to watch movies just as a matter of his course in his life. And those movies often will have some relationship to what's being worked on, even if it doesn't seem like it at all. But I would say Moonrise Kingdom is a little more, the research for me and Roman, I think, was what was it like when we were 12? Yeah, it was recalling those sensations and those memories of being a kid. It was just reaching back into your experience well, and not so much what happened, but also what we kind of wished would happen. If you had met a girl and you couldn't run off and have this adventure. But there was a girl who I had the biggest crush on in fourth grade, and she passed me a note once after school. When I opened the note, it says, I think you're cute. Call me. And it just, thinking of it, I get goose pimples now. But that's kind of, and I did call her, and I kind of choked. I didn't have anything interesting to ask her or say. But anyway, I kind of wished that we would have run off together in this way. So we get to do it in the movie."
95088," I would like to ask you about the story of the book you wrote. Writers, does anybody have an idea for a story? How about this time travel ad? Guy writes a classified that reads, wanted someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I've only done this once before. I want to find this guy. You know, see, maybe he believes in this stuff. I don't know. I think it could be funny. You want to do it? Can I get a couple of interns? Help me with the research. Me, too, please. Me. All right, give me the lesbian and the Indian, and I got a story. What'd you get? Got his name, where he works. What makes you think he won't slam the door on my face, too? Probably none of the other people were beautiful girls. Easier now. Do you sell guns here? Something sexy and affordable with killing power? Is there a pest problem? Well, if your ad had been written properly, I may have a better idea of what I need. I hope you worked harder on your calibrations. My calibrations are flipping pinpoint, OK? You ever face certain death? If it was so certain, I wouldn't be here, would I? I think you're ready for the next step, some basic training. I think I'm getting better than you. Let's not get ahead of yourself here, OK? I'm certain I'm being recorded. I'm certain I'm being followed. What's wrong with this guy? What makes you think there's something wrong with him? Because he thinks he can go back in time. What are you going back for? The mission has to do with regret, mistakes. No matter how tempting it will be, we're never ever going to say, hey, leave your Star Wars figurines in the box, because it'll be worth, like, hundreds more. So, Kenneth, why are you looking for a partner? The world is mostly full of jank holes. Take these creepy glasses off. Don't put these on yet. That dude right there crushes chicks. I believe that there are purists out there, and that's why I put that ad in the paper. I think you're ready. I trust you. You should. There are people following him. There are really people following him. This is intense. Going 15 miles an hour. You come to that launch site, you take my hand, and I'll show you who can't time travel. What's your story about? I don't know anymore, actually. It's my hope that if you're watching this video, something incredible has happened."

95207," And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. And I looked, and behold, was Death to sing, come and sing. History prefers legends to men. It prefers nobility to brutality. Storing speeches to quiet deeds. History remembers the battle, but forgets the blood. However history remembers me, before I was a president, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth. The hell will follow me. There is darkness everywhere, Mr. Lincoln. My mother was murdered. I can see the rage burning. Tip the balance for the good of all mankind. I shall kill them all.

Lived a lamb with a coat of remarkable sheen. It would glint in the sunlight all sparkly and clean, such a source of great pride that it caused him to preen. And he'd break out in high step and dance. He would dance for his neighbors across the way. I must say that they found his dancing and hancing for they'd also join in the play. Then one day..."

There's got to be some logical explanation. People don't appear out of thin air. She did. How? I don't know how. It's love. It's magic. Have you tried writing more? Write something about her and see if it comes true. If it does, this is a miracle. Calvin! Ellie! Bon appétit! That was insane! You manifested a woman with your mind. You can make her do anything you want. For men everywhere, tell me you're not going to let that go to waste. This is the true and impossible story of my very great love, Ruby Sparks. You may see this and think it's magic. Hi, Ruby! Hi! But falling in love is an act of magic. I don't know how to act about women. I know Ruby. I wrote her. Just don't tell me how it ends, okay?

It's an underground bunker where the president, vice president were taken if there's ever an attack on Washington. The bunker is changed randomly without notice.

I thought she was the most beautiful girl in the world. It took me a while to fall in love with him. We have a great relationship. There's 30 years between us, but he doesn't need Viagra. At least there is that option if he does, like I don't know if 10 years from now. We never sought out to build the biggest house in America. It just kind of happened. It's bigger than the White House. Two tennis courts. 30 bathrooms. Full-size baseball field. No, that's not my room. That's my closet. No way. Nothing's really normal about this life. We're in line to do a billion dollars in sales for the year. We're on top of the world. And it came to a screeching halt. The market fell over 700 points. I would say it's touch and go right now.

She knows we need to cut back, but she's still compulsive. What's happening now? Well, if I could afford a watch, I would tell you. Bankers are like vultures. Our big problem is Vegas. Our lenders have made it very clear that he'll have more money than he knows what to do with. He can go back to building his house if he turns over this building. Over my dead body.

And now the big comedian, Matt Pandepiglio. Hey, y'all ready to lip sync? I can't hear you. That's my lip sync joke. So here's what happened. My girlfriend Abby and I moved in together. She's great, and my sister Janet got engaged. You're next. Coming your way, baby. Better up. Everyone started talking about marriage. How long have you and Abby been together? Eight years. I don't remember being so long. That's ridiculous. And that night, Abby! I started walking in my sleep. There's a jackal in the room! Come back to bed. How long has this sleepwalking been going on? I don't think it's that serious. As things with my girlfriend got more tense, my sleepwalking got more dangerous. You did it, Matt. First place. Thank you! This was the first time I remember thinking, maybe I should see a doctor. And then I thought, maybe I'll eat dinner. I went with dinner. I've decided I'm not gonna get married until I'm sure that nothing else good can happen in my life. You should say that on stage. One day, I asked my girlfriend, what do you fear most? And she said, I fear you'll meet someone else, and you'll leave me and I'll be all alone. And she said, what do you fear most? And I said, bears. Has your girlfriend heard the jokes? No. You should probably mention it. You say you're gonna go see the doctor, you don't. You say you wanna be a comedian, you're a bartender. I mean, pick a damn plan and stick with it. He's kidding, but he's not as funny as you. My parents have been together 40 years, which is, yeah, no, but it's too long.

96488," If ever there is an air of intrigue and mystery around a pop artist, it is around the artist known as Rodriguez. We thought he was like the inner city poet. He was this wandering spirit around the city. He's like a wise man, a prophet. How many records do you think he sold in America? In America? Six. Born in a troubled city. But it's still a bit of a mystery how the first copy of Cold Fact actually came to South Africa but it spread very quickly. To many of us South Africans, he was the soundtrack to our lives. Everybody knew he had his records. The message he had was be anti-establishment. Really, the first opposition to apartheid, they'll tell you that they were influenced by Rodriguez. But nobody knew anything about him. He was a mystery. Then we found out that he had committed suicide. And a lot of people have different versions of the story. He set himself alight on stage. He reached down and pulled up a gun. I thought it'd make a good story. Find out how Rodriguez died. There was nothing on the record to tell us who he was or where he was from. So we started looking quite deeply at the lyrics. I met a girl in Dearborn. We found him, we found him. These are the days of miracles and wonder. I heard he did like a little construction work. He was really doing the work that no one else wanted to do. Rich in a lot of things, but perhaps not material things. I said, in South Africa, you are more popular than Elvis Presley. Next day, he says, Emerson, I gotta go on tour. I said, why is that, Rodriguez? This is really gonna be Rodriguez. We'll only know if he can actually sing these songs. And the best part, are still to come. Thanks for keeping me alive."

They were led to believe by the police that we'd done it, but I didn't do it, you know. I didn't have anything to do with it. Our understanding of what actually happened has changed. The spacing and the configuration of those injuries is not compatible with a serrated knife, or for that matter, any knife. How did you get on this jury? And he basically said dumb judges and dumb lawyers, they don't ask specific questions. This is more evidence and facts than against the West Memphis Three or me or anyone else.

You have got to be kidding me. That thing is going to murder me in my sleep. Somebody's going to murder you in your sleep. Frank, you need a project. Today we're going to start a garden. I'm not gardening! My program's goal is to improve your health. I would rather die eating cheeseburgers than live off steamed cauliflower. This is Jake Finn. He's been filling me in on the plans for the new library. It's his project. So you must remember the days when this library was the only way to learn about the world. Sounds like the same people who stopped coming here want to take away what's yours. They're going to have this fundraiser party thing on Friday and all the young hoity-toity couples are going to come. Sounds awful. Yeah. Do you want to come with me? Yes. Cool. There they are.

96792," You are, sweet master. Oh, you are. If I weren't a slave, I'd kiss you. Oh, my dear child, feel free to express your gratitude at all times. One thing I won't have around the house is class distinction. Oh, I see. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what. Nice work, if you can get it. I spent many happy moments in this contraption. Fact is, I spent many happy days in Kismet. Let me show you what I mean. I'm a slave, and I'm a slave. I'm a slave, and I'm a slave. I'm a slave, and I'm a slave. I'm a slave, and I'm a slave. Let me show you what I mean. The Pool of Love. Man, it is nice work, if you can get it. And I got it. MGM really rolled out the magic carpet. To transform Kismet from Broadway's bewitching extravaganza... to an exuberant and exciting screen musical show. When you see Marcina, you'll discover an Anne Blythe so lovely, so lyrical... take a look for yourself and listen. Jing, jingle, lingo, bongos, bangos, bright, shiny beats. Here's Seductive Lalou, whose heart belongs to a Baghdad daddy. Lalou is Dolores Gray, who came from nightclub and recording fame... to win additional popularity on the screen. Not since Nineveh, not since Sidon, not since Jericho started sliding... from the den of a horn that's never blown here. Take my hand, I'm a stranger in paradise. All lost in a wonderland. A stranger in paradise. Speaking of recordings, Vic de Mone sells millions of them. In Kismet, he's the handsome young Kaleef of Baghdad. Did any of you ever meet Omar the tentmaker? Well, here he is, recreated by Monty Woolley the laughmaker. Omar, she's gone! My boy Kaleef, don't chase girls through the streets. And through this fabulous land of kidnapped heron duties... wanders our vagabond hero. The rascal who knows every back door in Baghdad. How do I know? Behind that beard is me. Fate can play a trick with a twine... to weave the evil and good in one design. And so, my destiny, I look at you and cannot see. I think you'll agree that Kismet is a whopping spectacle. A multi-ring circus. Its color is richer, its dances are wilder... its splendor more lavish than anything you've ever seen on screen. And now, if you'll excuse me... I'll get back to my work. Oh, my God!"

I think without digital video I don't think I ever would have been making movies. Basically in my head I was like, you've got to be a dude who knows how to operate machines to do this job. I'm always looking for whatever is new to help just push the art form even further, to be able to make the things that you couldn't envision the day before. There isn't yet a superior or even an equal imaging technology to film, but we're being forced into transition. You can't shoot 3D on film, so film has been dead in my heart for 10 years. I hate 3D. I put on those glasses, I get sick to my stomach. The whole 3D phenomenon, it's a marketing scheme, isn't it? I really felt I should call film on the phone and say I've met someone. Because I really thought, okay, this is the future. The issue is it's different. How is it different than how do you use it to tell a story? It's up to the filmmaker."

And it's not just a game. I'm so closely attached to it. This is my identity. It's Fez. I'm a guy making Fez. That's about it. Making it was about, let me take my deepest flaws and vulnerabilities and put them in the game. I'm on the line. Me. Like my name, my career. If this fails, I don't think I'll work in games again.

It's either the amendment or this confederate peace you cannot have both. How many hundreds of thousands of dad done your administration? Congress must never declare equal those whom God created unequal. Leave the constitution alone. We're stepped out upon the world stage now. We're the fate of human dignity in our hands.

O que aconteceu com o seu rosto? De manhã você fica um deslumbo? Que parar você se sentir em casa? Tem filhos e é uma ótima. Big Crystal. Patrín Blay. Marisa Lomé. Preciso fazer o número dois. Preciso fazer o número dois. O papai sempre canta pra mim. Saia, saia, dona caquinha. E nade na piscininha. Eu sei que é escuro o lugar onde está. Mas aqui fora você vai amar."
99468," I want us to remember what happened that day and be horrified by ourselves. New York in the late 1980s was a completely schizophrenic divided city. New York is now the capital of racial violence. If I had more bullets I would have shot them all again and again. Criminality, gang wars, drug wars. We were supposed to be afraid. It would have been irrational not to be afraid. Off with the camera, man! Last night a woman jogger was found unconscious and partially clothed in Central Park. She was beaten and sexually assaulted. A woman jogging in Central Park. Central Park was holy. It was the crime of the century. Five youths were arrested at 96th Street all between 14 and 15 years of age. They got him! You can only imagine the pressure to have this crime solved and solved quickly. First we was all together. Then they started to put us in different rooms separately. What did you do? Who were you with? Who did you come with? The tone was very scary. I felt like they might take us to the back of the precinct and kill us. You're not going to go home until you give up your story. I told my son to go to the park that night. I felt guilty. I'm telling the guy, I don't know what you're talking about. They're getting a little angry. And they're like, you know, you did it, didn't you? He had been interrogated for over 24 hours. That amounts to pressure. These young men were guilty. It was almost unquestioned. The police controlled the story. They created the story. They seized on the fears of the people, wilding the bestial characterization of the black man. There's no T&A match whatsoever to any of these boys. I was going nuts. No blood on the kids. Nobody could identify them. But if they confessed, they confessed and that was that. A lot of people didn't do their jobs. Reporters, police, prosecutors, defense lawyers. This was institutional protectionism. We falsely convicted them and we walked away from our crime. This is the ultimate siren that says none of us is safe."

99839," In the 1970s, before there was this guy, or this guy, or even this guy, there was... When I was a kid, I really wanted to be Paul Williams. He wrote Evergreen for her, and Rainy Days and Mondays for them, and the Rainbow Connection for this guy. I wrote this song with a girl's name. Do you ever tell a girl, say, I was thinking of you, and I wrote this? A lot of holiday in's and Thursday's lines. And he was in movies like this, and one stuff like this. And I always thought he died too young. But last year, I found out something that amazed me. He's not dead. I'll never forget today, ever. Why are you wasting your time making a film about Paul Williams? Who cares? Come on, guys, that's enough. Get out. I followed him anyway. You know, when he was a kid, he was a little kid. He was a little kid. He was a little kid. He was a little kid. He was a little kid. He was a little kid. He was a little kid. He was a little kid. You know why? This guy's a national treasure. He should be getting his own night on American Idol. Where's he been? Golden Globe winning Hall of Fame songwriter, Paul Williams. Oh my God, I can't watch it. Look, all I know is that when he had everything, he was miserable. And now he's got a lot less, and he seems pretty happy. How can that be? I don't want to talk about that. I gotta say, for a documentary, it's pretty good. We've got a love story. Have your heart set on it. Does it matter? Does it matter what I do? If you do, I'll go into it in an hour. There's friendship. Are we out here to make the documentary about power, or are we out to like, dish the dirt? There's a little sex. And there's a young hero. He starts with nothing, he gets everything, he loses it all, and then he finds redemption. And did I say there's a love story? We pull you in here, it just gets really authentic, and it gets my life. It becomes the Paulie and Steve show. You may find this hard to believe, but this almost never happens. You need a picture of this, huh? You live in my heart. This is not a mask, is it? This is seven months of nothing but banana daiquiris."
99917," Hi, welcome to Trailers from Hell, I'm Larry Karazewski. In my eyes, filmmaker Shane Caruth, after only two movies, is one of the most exciting directors in the world right now. He creates his films like a true artist, he does it all. He writes, directs, produces, stars, scores, edits. He's even his own DP, he's even his own distributor. I don't know how he does it. He's an absolute total filmmaker. His first movie, Primer, won the grand prize at the Sundance Film Festival, but today we're going to look at what I think is his masterpiece from 2013, Upstream Color. Do you know this place? Shane makes movies that look and sound like nothing else. He's one of the few people out there pushing filmmaking into uncharted territory, trying to tell stories in a new way. Unintimidated by audience test screenings or studio acceptance, his films have a singular vision. And yes, they are complex and puzzling and full of big ideas, but I also find them extremely emotional, particularly Upstream Color. You just become so drawn into the character played by the amazing Amy Simons. It's just a phenomenal performance, raw. I was a complete wreck after I saw this movie. I recently hosted a screening of the film at the American Cinematheque and when I intro'd it to the audience, I kind of felt like Dr. Timothy Leary leading a group on their first acid experience. Okay, breathe deep, don't freak out. Shane's movies are trips, they're headsy, but he plays everything in a down-to-earth manner. Weird, complex, scientific ideas are tossed off naturalistically. He takes an outlandish concept and he presents it almost matter-of-factly. Like this movie, it centers around a pig, orchid, worm life cycle that I can't even begin to explain, yet I'm still fascinated and moved. The film also has an interesting structure. It's a triptych. It begins as a thriller, then becomes about a relationship, which leads us into an almost silent third act that asks a lot about the nature of personal identity, what controls us. Shane wrote the score for the film, actually before it was shot, as part of the screenwriting stage. So scenes are built around the sound. Sometimes it feels like a Brian Eno ambient musical. One of the films that Shane says that influenced him to become a filmmaker was Francis Coppola's The Conversation. And you can kind of feel that influence. The Walter Murch layers of sounds, the sad, slow loneliness mixed with the trappings of an intense thriller. Upstream Color was made on a very low budget, but it doesn't feel it. It has an almost Kuprakian sense of control. I can't wait to see what Mr. Carruth does next."
99992," You're a terrorist. We've got you. You're finished. You're done. You agree to watch him and talk to us. You're out of here like nothing ever happened. Back to your mom. Back to your boy. Nobody dies. Nobody gets hurt. We do this together. But you have to be sure. We need to talk. Now. You make mistakes, I'm dead. We lose you all. Then you're back like nothing ever happened. Don't leave Belfast. We're not done yet. Gavin knows. This is a joke to make you think he knows. I can't hold on any longer. I need the word now. I want to take her out. That's out of the question. You just got started. He won't stop until he's put a bullet in someone's head. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm not gonna let that happen. We made a deal. Relax. We're all on the same side. You do this, our play is dead. Did you kill him? Did you kill him? He said nobody dies. Nobody gets hurt. No."
