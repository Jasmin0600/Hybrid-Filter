From Jane Austen's timeless classic comes the story of a woman, a captain, and a desire so strong, It will stay, won't you? It could destroy them both. To involve yourself with a man with no fortune, no connection. Between her heart's desire... He is charming, he is clever. You have an extraordinary ability to discompose my friends, sir. You have an extraordinary ability to influence her, ma'am. And her family's disdain... You prefer a sailor. Your own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland. Lies a woman open to persuasion. The critics call persuasion a Cinderella romance so delicious you want it never to end. And simply the finest movie of this year or any year. If you adored a room with a view, then you'll cherish... Persuasion."

1P8JYwOhWoc,128,Jupiter's Wife (1994)," To my parents lived in New York for many years, their European roots to find them. My Greek mother boasted about the blueness of the Aegean and my father praised the Swiss Alps. But for me, none of Europe's shrines could compete with a place that was only several blocks from my home. Central Park is where my brother and I found native soil. Years later, Central Park's history and presence still fascinate me. A few days ago, I was sitting on a bench near the boat pond trying to imagine my surroundings as they looked a century ago without asphalt or car traffic. Back then, the park was stocked with wild deer and its meadows were home to sheep and horned cattle. There were gilded bird cages and children driving goat drawn carriages. My thoughts were in this Victorian park when a woman with a team of dogs caught my attention. Come, come. Why would a professional dog walker carry such a big backpack? Then I see the backpack is loaded with laundry and blankets. Maybe it was her air of well-being that made me curious. When I introduced myself, she said her name was Maggie. Then she calmly said that she'd been expecting me, that she had extrasensory perception and had been communicating with me for several days. The next morning, I find myself near Bethesda Fountain looking for Maggie. Sometimes I forget I have a face. I'm so used to doing this without a fountain. I'm Hera, sister of Zeus. Now, Zeus and Jupiter are the same. That'll be a relief. But in Stairway to Heaven, there's a little, and did you know, your stairway lies on the whispering wind. The whispering wind is the voices, the radio control. Jupiter controls the radio waves. Things don't necessarily get clearer to me the more Maggie explains them, but I managed to piece this much together. She claims her father was the Hollywood movie star, Robert Ryan. She once had an apartment on the Upper West Side with a roommate named P. Green Palmer. She mentions a horse named Tangle and having once worked in Central Park as a carriage driver. Her oldest son, Michael, was born in 1969. The quintuplets, Justin, Elizabeth, two Tracies and Isidore, were born sometime later. When I asked her who her husband was, she says his name is Jupiter."

AzwMZVRxTE0,252,I.Q. (1994)," We all know Albert Einstein as the crazy-haired genius who proposed that E equals MC squared. I hope so. But did you know he was also a consummate matchmaker? Don't let your brain interfere with your heart. Before you start scratching your head though, yes, the matchmaker part is actually just Hollywood doing what it does best. Wondering what if in the romantic comedy IQ. When motor mechanic Ed first sets his eyes on mathematician Catherine, he goes into an excited state. Past, the present and the future, they all went together. I had kids with her. I could see the kids. I had two boys and three, no, three boys, two boys and three, no. Excuse me. How long will all this take? That's up to you. It is? The car, you nut. The bad news for Ed is that Catherine is engaged. The good news is that Catherine's uncle is Albert Einstein. She needs us to go out with someone like you. The problem is she would never go out with someone like you. That's easy. Just lend me your brain for a couple of days. This flippant remark sets off an unstoppable course of actions. With Einstein's help, Ed presents the paper on nuclear fusion to impress Catherine, adding an atomic twist to the classic Cyrano de Bejarac tale. But like all good plans, things go awry. I want you to meet the President of the United States. Like? The Russians have announced that they'll have a working model within the year. The President would like to make an announcement that we are building a prototype here in New Jersey. I'd like to be able to tell them we'll have something ready by say, um... Seven? IQ would be like any other romantic comedy if it weren't directed by Fred Skepsy. That he's managed to infuse a cockamamie story with such believability is testament to his skill. If you're not good enough to entice you, then the talented cast including Stephen Fry and comic veteran Walter Matow should. We're not entirely sure that Einstein's laws of relativity were formulated with human relations in mind. That said, you don't need to be super intelligent to enjoy this simple and cute comedy. Lady, the only thing you're afraid of is yourself. Why do you do that? What? Brando. If the real Einstein had watched this movie, we're sure he would have espoused the relative merits of IQ."

F6Dk9asJ0QY,366,"Wes Craven's New Nightmare (Nightmare on Elm Street Part 7: Freddy's Finale, A) (1994)"," Hey, my name is Axel Carolyn and this is Wes Craven's New Nightmare. I think that like everybody my age who likes horror movies, I grew up watching Freddy Krueger or at least being aware of Freddy Krueger. I don't think I'd ever watched the first one until I was like maybe 13 or 14, but I remember hearing about New Nightmare coming out and I remember it being at this festival in Brussels where I was at the time and I couldn't go because I wasn't old enough to get in. And I just was obsessed with it and I was obsessed with that movie specifically. And then I saw the Nightmare on Elm Street series, but completely in the wrong order. It started with four and somehow I thought that four was amazing. And then I saw one and it was almost a disappointment because it wasn't as funny as four. But then when I finally saw seven, which was the last one I watched, I think, like I had seen for six, I absolutely adored it. It's a total classic. Mark it, common mark. I'm doing a film about my nightmares as I'm dreaming now. In order for the movie to continue, it was dependent on me having more nightmares. Well, fortunately I did. So Wes Craven's New Nightmare came out 10 years after the original, so it's a return to Wes Craven to the series. And he always said that he didn't like the sequels. There's a line in the movie that says, when the story dies, the nightmare is set free, which in the movie is supposed to mean that Freddy is not contained in the sequels anymore, so he's set loose. But it also kind of says that the story dies when it becomes too familiar or when it's not scary anymore, which is very much a dig on the sequels. By this point when he made the film, Freddy had become such a huge phenomenon that Wes Craven chose to do something very clever, which is explore the franchise in a very postmodern way. It's a reflection of the place of Freddy and the first film in film history and pop culture in general. In the movie, Freddy attacks its creators. He attacks Heather Langenkamp and her husband and Wes Craven and Robert Englund and John Saxon and Bob Shea. And what's weird is that Lynn Shea is in there too. She was in the first film, but she plays a nurse. She doesn't play herself for some reason. And it's the script within the script. The story unfolds as Wes writes it in the story, which is kind of like Scream a couple of years later would have a film within the film. It's full of little throwbacks to the first film. Like there's the opening with the claw and then there's the film gag and there's that line screw your pass and there's a line whatever you do don't fall asleep. There's a streak of white hair in Nancy's hair. There's the babysitter's death who dies like Tina. There's the gooey steps like in the nightmare in the first one. There's a Freddy stretching arm. All that is kind of is right there. We've just seen that there's a shadow that looks like Nosferatu. So the reflection goes beyond just a place of the film within the franchise, but also extends it to other movies and references like Nosferatu, but also Hansel and Gretel and fairy tales. And it's really just kind of exploring what Freddy means for people nowadays. There's a lot of crossovers between reality and fiction, which were kind of weird. Like here in the film, Hesra Langenkamp has a stalker and in real life she also did have one. And also there's a lot of stuff about earthquakes in Los Angeles and it was shot, the scenes of the earthquake were shot two weeks before Northridge. So it was one of those weird things of just shooting something and then the same thing happening very soon afterwards. And they shot a lot of pickup shots that they inserted in the film later on."

GYB9e6A_zWQ,471,"Hudsucker Proxy, The (1994)"," But let me ask you a question. Would an imbecile come up with this? I designed it myself. This is the sweet baby that's going to put Hudson right back on top. Joel and Ethan Cohen have a new movie out. It's called Burn After Reading. And as they have in the past, they're following a dark and brooding movie with a comedy. So it seems like a good time to look back at some of their earlier attempts at comedy. And one of my favorites is The Hudsucker Proxy. Now this isn't one of their best known or best loved movies. It came out in 1994 and it's been a little bit lost in the shuffle. And it's not one of their masterpieces. But there are details and themes and scenes and performances in this movie that make it really a shame to miss. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Finlansson. Say am I interested to know that I studied a little Finnish myself in high school. Let's see, I hope I'm not too rusty. Taxa spusa, naval mentors. There's wonderful period production design the movie set in the late 1950s. And there's also an absolutely over the top wonderfully mannered performance by Jennifer Jason Lee playing a classic fast talking dame in the screwball tradition. You forgot what major ideas excited you in the first place. Buggle for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out of here. You two sisters, move it. Out, out, out. And then there's Paul Newman. You love his lemonade. He's the embodiment of socially responsible capitalism in real life. In this movie, he's Sidney J. Musburger, the ruthless head of the Hudsucker Corporation. What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder. A puppet. A proxy. A pawn. Sure, sure. Some jerk we can really push around. This movie is trying to do a few too many things. There's a lot of sort of vague mystical stuff about time and fate. But when it's sharpest, this movie is just really fantastic. Seriously, Amy, it's what your beatnik friends call karma. Great circle of life, death and rebirth. I love this movie's over the top fantastic portrayal of corporate life and also of the workings of consumer capitalism. How a simple idea, maybe a dumb idea, you know, for kids, becomes a multi-million dollar fad. It's just too much fun to miss."

SvvjIuAdGqw,602,"Great Day in Harlem, A (1994)"," This probably is the greatest picture of that era of musicians I think ever taken. And I'm so proud of it because now it's all over the United States, probably the world. All of the young boys, see? As I recall, it was very early. Early in the morning, ten o'clock or something like that. It was like a family reunion, you know, being in one spot with all these great jazz musicians at one time. I mean, we called big dogs, I mean the giants were there. Prez, Monk. I looked around and there was Count Basie, Charlie Minkoff, Dizzy Gillespie, Jerry Mulder, and I said, what a minor. Can you imagine if everybody had their instruments and played? Back in 1958, when New York was still the jazz capital of the world, you could hear important music. All over town, representing an extraordinary range of periods and styles. This film is the story of a magic moment when dozens of the greatest jazz stars of all time gathered for an astonishing photograph. This thing all started I guess in the summer of 1958, at which time I was not a photographer. Art Kane went from this day to become a leading player in the field of photography. This was his first picture. I was an art director, a fairly well-known art director. I was art director of Seventeen magazine. He was one of the two or three really great young art directors in New York at that point. Henry Wolfe and Art Kane and one or two other people were really considered the bright young Turks. Robert Benton had not yet become a celebrated Hollywood filmmaker. He had only just become Esquire's new art director, hoping to please his jazz fan boss with an idea for an all jazz issue. But his inexperience, combined with Kane's inexperience, gave us this historic document. I was new enough and dumb enough in those days that I was willing to try all sorts of risky things. So Benton suggests to, I guess it was Harold Hayes who was the editor at the time, hey why don't we give Art Kane a chance. He's really, he's never worked professionally before, but he's got a lot of talent and he loves jazz, you know. I called Art and asked him if he would come and talk to Harold and photograph this section. So I suggested that we start this story off with a gigantic spread whereby we get together every jazz musician we can possibly assemble. But instead of doing it in a controlled situation of a studio. I didn't have a studio. I was not even a professional photographer in a studio. Art then said he wanted to do it up in Harlem. Harlem, that's where jazz came in in New York. That was the moment where I began to get very nervous because we will never be able to control this up there. And so began a great day in Harlem. Ah, yeah. Do you remember anything about how you got there dizzy? Who told you to come and how you showed up so early? No. Whatever you remember about the day this picture was taken, how you happened to be standing up there with those guys. Honey, I'm trying to forget it. I was staying up on 153rd Street right across from where Coleman Alkins lived. I probably took a taxi down. I don't know. I came with Tav Jordan and the gentleman on my left. We all came together and I stayed about two hours, I guess. I had to go to work. Nat Hentoff had come around saying if you want to have your picture taken for Esquire magazine, be at Lennox Avenue and whatever it was, 125th Street, I think. This was a remarkable idea and that's why I showed up there. I was so fascinated with the idea that I say I can't believe all these people are going to show up. There they were. What time was it called for? I can't remember, about 11? Ten. That's early. That's probably why I didn't believe anybody would show up. In those days, most musicians, myself especially, get to bed at four o'clock in the morning. One didn't go to sleep immediately. It took a long time thinking of the days happening. So you wake up at the rule, 12 or 1, ravenously hungry, go out and have something to eat and wonder what you were going to do with the long day coming. I was hanging around with little Lion Smith by that time, so I came down with him and then it was only later on that I realized that this was for Esquire and who most of the rest of these people were. Because at that time I was really only interested in stride piano. When you hear voicing like this. That's Willie Lion Smith. Those are his chords. Lucky Roberts was one of the first stride pianists. Lucky was, in his time, a legendary pianist. There was nobody who had the reach and the imagination. I mean, the Lion was good, but Lucky was the stride pianist. He was 5'2 or 5'4 or something. He was very short, but he was very powerful. He was a gymnast earlier on. There was a story that was reported in Rudy Blesch's book, They All Played Ragtime, that Lucky Roberts was walking alone at night and these young thugs were going to mug him. And he succeeded in grabbing both of them, breaking their bones and dragging them into the police station. I don't know why they picked this particular street or this brownstone, but that was the case. And here's my dear friend Scoble Brown. I think I was residing at Pop Collins House, which was a notorious home for musicians where you could come eat and sleep for a reasonable sum. I think his dinners were 35 cents a piece and they were out of sight. And the rooms might have been, let's see, no, the rooms might have been $8 or $9 a week. It was important for me to live in New York because I was just building a reputation for myself. And the record companies are here and the booking agents are here and all the clubs are here, plus all the inspiration. Because living in New York at that time, you saw everybody, everyone there, you're allowed to run into them any day. It is true that we all had more chances to get together in those days. As I say, we were up all night. I don't know one person who was not up all night because they were all very busy playing, you know. And the extraordinary thing about this picture is that there are so many innovators. I was working with the Loners at this period. We were working in the fire spot. And so that's probably how I heard about it. Well, Bob Altshuler was the publicity guy at Riverside Records and he was in charge of getting Monk. I received a phone call from Esquire magazine to see whether it might be possible to arrange to bring Philonius Monk on a certain date for a special photograph that was going to be taken. And knowing how difficult Monk can be. I figured out Monk had this facade the way he walked around, looking like maybe Joe Moncanata. People are afraid to speak to him, you know. He's doing certain things, eccentric type things, you know. I really love Monk. I'm not with him. Because he had higher morals than any man I've ever met. He was something else.

jKvO2TYPuTw,613,Jane Eyre (1996)," I hear you're a wicked child, Jenn-Erv. Alone and unwanted. Orphaned by fate. Both parents died of typhus when the child was but a few months old.

q4pIsTM3UZM,615,Bread and Chocolate (Pane e cioccolata) (1973)," You know the feeling of going into your grandmother's kitchen or your mother's kitchen when it was just a totally good feeling? There are smells in the air and there's family around, maybe at a holiday time or Thanksgiving. My extended family in general was a joy to me. So there was a lot of singing, ukulele playing, dancing, and all of that stuff. Everyone was out there and there was a lot of performing going on. On the holidays I'd go to the kitchen and the aroma would be in the air. The whole mood would be different. There would be more forgiveness in the air, a frenetic pace, but a very welcoming kind. Taste a little of this, do a little of that, watch what's going on. I lived in the kitchen. My grandmother was a fabulous cook, ran this kitchen, did most of the cooking herself, would grind her own meat, clean her own chickens, get fresh eggs. So this is in upstate New York in the 50s and there was a lot of fresh produce available from the farmers and there was an orchard next door and there was a dairy farm across the road and it all seemed to fit together. My grandmother always made a deal out of the presentation of the food. It was like silver to me, beautiful silver platters, they were huge. It was probably stainless steel, but it was great to me. I've always been drawn to making food. So I got my first job when I was 17. My first real job was as a bagel baker and there's something about baking. I think, I know I just like eating the baked goods more than anything else. So I went to college, I worked my way not through college, my parents helped, but I always got jobs in the food biz. I would get a job as a short order cook, I would get a job as a pizza maker, I would get a job making donuts, you know on the midnight shift making donuts. So I kept going back to bakery, bakery, bakery. And later Mary and I who were living together and a third friend Nan decided to open up a bakery. We thought we could do it and so we opened Bread and Chocolate in 1980. It wasn't until I had Bread and Chocolate for many, many years, maybe five or six years, standing there doing this rote work of running the business, of being scared of going out of business, making croissants, that it occurred to me that I was in show business. And that in fact it had a lot in common with show business, theater, show business, music and baking all appeal to the same thing. And the fact that people, mostly kids, would walk in back and all of a sudden it was like they were in Oz. Their mouths would drop open, their eyes would get big. They would see the big mixers in the oven that revolved and the big freezers in the refrigerators. Just the scale of everything, the tables that we have are bigger than their whole kitchens at home. The big vats, 40 gallon cans full of chocolate chips, whole wheat flour, oat bran, wheat bran, sugar, salt, brown sugar, all the different ingredients and the big buckets of oil and honey and molasses. People watch their name being written on a cake or their mother's name. Happy Mother's Day, Mom. They see it being written and they see the flowers being put on the cake. You feel you're a part of it. You feel like you're involved because you got to see it and you get to store that away. And for children, of course, that's their whole life is made of. Images that have impact. That's the high point of their childhood. They'll never forget it. I try to provide that at the bakery every single day. For children who come in, for adults who come in. It's that aspect of theater. It's like having a play but having the same audience every day. It's like having an ongoing play. You see fat people come in who are eating way too much and your heart goes out to them because they ask something and you know in your heart that they shouldn't be eating it. Am I contributing to their downfall? But then you see other people, runners come in and they only eat oat bran muffins. They want to know how many milligrams of fat are in something. And I think this is just as bad as a fat person eating a brownie. Is this person being so fanatically neurotic about God forbid they should get a little bit of butter fat in their body. It's going to slow them down a quarter of a tenth of a second in a 10k race. I mean you see it all and your heart goes out to all these people. It's a very good practice. You know the buddhists call it a practice whatever it is you're doing. And the bakery, the food business, I have no regrets about. It's right work. It's right livelihood. I feel very good about what I do. It provides a lot of opportunities for insight into all of life. Not just into recipes for muffins or croissants. We have a special gift in that we have the same clientele day in and day out. And because of that we get to build long term relationships. We are part of the community. People are born not at bread and chocolate but essentially they are. Babies come in when they are a week old with their mothers and their mothers start sitting and having tea and schmoozing with the other mothers. So babies consciousness. Children from their earliest ages, bread and chocolate is a part of their life. An important part. They get their cakes. They get their bread. Their mother goes there when they're feeling bad or when they're feeling happy. They want something from the bakery. Everything is essentially the collective effort of the whole planet. So the butter we use was once grass in a field in Sonoma County. The wheat comes from Montana or Texas. The salt comes from the Pacific Ocean. The milk comes from Sonoma. The raspberries and the jam come from Oregon and the sugar comes from Hawaii and all these things. The can, who knows where the tin is mined and the paper that was printed on it says raspberry preserves. So in this little bakery we have the whole planet. Thank you."

XU6e0ZrUZ60,661,James and the Giant Peach (1996)," Welcome to a magical world You're enormous bugs! Fascinating, isn't it? where courage can lead to adventure He's gonna cut me in half! and hope is the path to a place called home. We have made it. What a wonderful sun. From the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas comes a new family adventure from Walt Disney Pictures. James and the Giant Peach. For me, seeing what you perceive as real objects coming to life is still really impressive. Beemar! For James and the Giant Peach, director Selick guided an award-winning team of animators, illustrators, set designers and camera operators on 22 sound stages over a three-year production schedule, all working to push the artistic limits of stop-motion animation. They're puppets. They're repositionable and they just stay in the pose you put them in until you put them in another one. So in each frame, we take the puppet and make a small movement. Take the frame, move it again, and once you've done that 24 times, you have one second of film. Sometimes you have multiple characters and with each character, there's multiple joints. So there's a lot of things to keep track of. To complete just one minute of finished film takes an entire week of animating. Put them up! Come on! Give me your best shot! Oh, good shot! And to heighten the fantasy of stop-motion, Selick decided to include live-action film as well. Action. I felt that why not save that automatic jolt of magic you get from stop-motion for when the magic is released. For me, it was best personified by sticking to the stop-motion for the miracle world, then mixing it at the end. Rolling! Three marks. Action. How dare you speak to us like that! Hey, you old biddies! Bugs! Giant bugs! The cast of James and the Giant Peach is a world-class ensemble of talent. Including Academy Award winners Richard Dreyfuss and Susan Sarandon, Jane Leaves from TV's hit show, Frasier, and British comedic actors Simon Callow, David Thulis, Miriam Margulies, Joanna Lumley from Absolutely Fabulous, and Paul Terry as James. Lovely! Together, they breathe life into the story of a young boy's fantastic adventures with some unusual friends aboard a magic giant peach. We are in the middle of the, how do you say, the big puddle. The film really empowers you. I mean, I think it's great for kids to know that they can figure things out and they make the difference and that your fears won't have any power unless you give it to them. Hooligans! Ruffians! James and the Giant Peach happened to be my little sister's favorite book growing up and I sort of got into it and used to read it to her all the time. So, you know, when I was asked to do this, it was quite a thrill. Shake your floo-be-toe, brothers! The story of James and the Giant Peach has been a favorite of children all over the world since it was first published in 1961 by British writer Roald Dahl, author of the classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. What do we do? The seagulls! It's our only children! I think that there's something about Roald Dahl that will always be timeless with kids. It's about kids solving problems. It's about them overcoming odds with a lot of humor, with a lot of invention. I've got him! Seagulls away! He's lifting! By doing it stop-motion, you just get that extra dimension to it that I think will really satisfy anybody who loves the book. Add the songs of Grammy Award-winning composer Randy Newman and you have a lyrical journey into a bizarre new world Holy shipwreck! where anything can happen and does. James and the Giant Peach."

do_9g3isO0c,671,Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (1996)," She has exploding boogers! Man, I really caught one. Hollywood has certainly produced its share of bad movies, but thousands of miles away in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, they found a welcome home at Mystery Science Theater 3000. You took my employee of the month parking spot, you bastard! The thing that people identify us the most for is screaming back at the culture. I have a brain the size of a chickpea. You're not supposed to talk back at a movie. Stop the movie! That's what's going on here. Something everybody wants to do. We're just putting it out there. Deal with it, you big, huge, giant babies! And sometimes it works and sometimes not so good. Now, with the help of the performers themselves shooting their own behind-the-scenes video, the Sci-Fi Channel goes behind the curtain at Mystery Science Theater 3000 for a true insider's look at the making of this popular cult series. What's this, though? Hey, look at that. We're appearing as Chris Bix. Well, hello, you handsome devil. Whoa, weird reindeer. The Sci-Fi Channel presents the making of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Hi, everybody, and welcome to the satellite alone. Hey, now, these guys do a similar thing to what we do. Anyway, there's Mel Gibson. Can I just get a piece of that shrimp before you turn it into shrimp pudding? Is that an Oak Ridge boy? Careful! Stop cutting already. I'm woozy from hunger, Mike. There's about a one-in-four chance we're gonna come out of this alive. Mike is trapped up in space with his two robot companions forced by this evil scientist's mother who used to torment us, and now she's making us watch these movies because her son told her to before she killed her son. And, well, it gets confusing. Anyway, we're up in space watching bad movies. Her van is rigged where she can just press a button and show the movie. No. Oh, I don't think she has a long-term plan. I think she just wants to be antagonizing. I will dog you to the end of the universe. That's where she draws her life force. I'm sending you the worst movie I know. It's called Riding with Death and it Sucks on Toes. Hang on, Bobo. Hang on! I'm not real clear on the logistics of it, but Pearl can do it. Mark my words. Whoa, hey, it's cool. Almost hit you, and I swear, but it's mellow. It's really tough for us to get good movies, the right kind of good movies. All righty, I'm coming up on your mudflaps at 67. Coming up on your mudflaps. People have such cute names for sex. Good movies are bad movies that have good sound. My rigid grill structure is bearing down on your unprotected cargo door. But we love them when we get them because they really are the best of the worst. It all started in 1988 when Jim Mallon and Kevin Murphy hired Joel Hodgson to turn one of his hilarious sketch ideas into a television show. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Thanks, Mark! Thanks for having us! Oh, what a movie, not like they say on Wayne's World! It needed a name. I think they kind of just looked at each other and combined the words, mystery, science, theater. At first they thought 2000, but 3000 just seemed like a thousand more. Ah, my ribs. Come in, Joel, my little space guy. Mystery Science Theater began airing in the fall of 1989. In the middle of the fifth season, Joel left the show. Okay, thanks, bye-bye! The unenviable task of replacing him went to Mike Nelson. What's the name on that? Nelson, Mike Nelson. Felson? No, Nelson. Felson, right? Nelson, Nelson. Nelson? Mike Nelson, the man himself, the man behind the character. I had been making broccoli balls at TGI Fridays and thought, well, you know, this isn't as fulfilling as I thought it would be, so I'll try this out. I think he's incredibly smart, incredibly funny. He's a wonderful head writer. They made a better offer here. Ah, okay. He has a vision that I could only aspire to. But it was surprising sort of in this venue to see people write letters saying, you know, your face is misshapen. It's like, no, it's not, is it? The best way to describe Mike is he's got a real big face. It's a big, meaty sort of roast of a face, you know, a rolled roast, sort of a barren of beef of a face on Mike. I do have one of the largest faces in show business. Thank you. Don't Mike the puppets. What are you doing? Then I became a mummified. I'm the one who's talking. Mike me. I think Kevin is the little kid of the show. Good God. We try not to make any comments that we can't back up with actual knowledge. Morons, morons, all of you. He's got an hilariously twisted mind. I think our sense of humor is motivated by some good educations that have subsequently been wasted on popular culture. You're just jealous, Nelson. I have a fine butt. You wish you had my butt. I like my butt. I like your butt. He's a big shaved bear, basically. When writer puppeteer Trace Ballou departed the show at the end of the seventh season. I haven't gotten all the bugs worked out of it yet. I thought I'd try it out on you. Writer Bill Corbett stepped into the puppeteer's pit and brought the wisecracking crow back to life. It's weird to watch a man grow into being a puppeteer. That's a disturbing thing. I taxed my pretty limited manual dexterity. Oh, geez, that's great. Thanks, thanks. Now he's trying to slice it. That's nice. He's trying to slice my hand up. Good. Now that's fine, Mike. You cut my hand up and serve it to me. But he's fit right in. He's actually from being a totally inept puppeteer before he started to now he's able to handle manipulating all the arms and everything. And he's also a distinguished playwright, which he lords over us all the time. Ready for my close-up now? Your reports of my death were greatly exaggerated. And the changes continued. Writer-actress Mary Jo Peel took over as Mike Nelson's new nemesis, Pearl Forrester. And? And I am going to box your ears if you don't help us get off this planet. Mary Jo Peel is a very smart and witty writer. She adds so much to the show. It's wonderful to have a female character of such strength and craziness on the show. She plays psycho really well. Hey, I'm laughing here. Flying around in her rocket Volkswagen, Pearl lands on strange new planets, allowing the writers to introduce hysterical, bizarre new characters to the show. Hey, what do you think of these characters? Pretty evolved. Action. Mike! We're under attack! We are now going through time and space and having fun with every science fiction and fantasy convention that we can get our hands on. A planet where apes evolved from men? My name is Bobo. Professor Bobo, son of Coco, and heir to the lineage of Godo, Bogo, and Chim Chim. And I'm Peanut. After winning numerous awards... Daytime drama's most popular sexual predator. Spawning a big screen feature film and amassing an official fan club base of nearly 100,000 members, the phenomenon of Mystery Science Theater shows no signs of slowing down. We'll be right back. When the making of Mystery Science Theater 3000 returns, we'll go behind the doors of the writing room for a look at the unique Mystery Science writing process. You wouldn't look good bald. And the shooting of the famous theater scenes. Hi, this is Bill Corbett here in the MST 3K writing room, giving you a little tour of where the wackiness starts."

nldNot-vEjc,674,Barbarella (1968)," It begins with Jane Fonda, and it makes science fiction something else. Jane is Barbarella, the most beautiful creature of the future. Barbarella is a five-star double-rated astro-navigatrix whose specialty is love. 40,000 AD style. And David Hemmings plays her rescuer whom she thanks in her own unique way. Roger Vadim, the director filming the way out adventure for Paramount, is known for his bold approach to filmmaking. Here Vadim sets his characters in a world of a far-off universe and helps them do their thing. When Jane Fonda's not in front of the camera, she makes a home for husband Roger Vadim. As movie makers, they're often on different projects and continents apart. Now Barbarella gives them a chance to live and work together. David Hemmings, best known for his dramatic performances in Blow Up and Camelot, has a change of pace by starring in a fantasy film for the first time. To project visions of things to come, the film's production team creates over 200 full-body costumes. Each one weird enough to shake up any visitor from Earth. In a sequence filmed for Barbarella, the natives of a wild planet become restless and revolt in a huge labyrinth laid out over four giant sound stages. Jane Fonda, who began her acting career in summer stock with her father Henry Fonda, has since gone on to many important film roles, among them Barefoot in the Park. In Barbarella, she again brings her flair for comedy, her poise and sex appeal to the screen. A dazzling combination for a beautiful adventurous. One of the strangest creatures of the way out world is the ornithanthrope, great flying birdman, played by John Philip Law, whom film audiences will remember from The Russians are Coming. Here John and Jane film one of Barbarella's flights from danger. This is the exciting and fanciful world of Barbarella, a world filled with inventiveness and imagination. A world where Jane Fonda as Barbarella does her thing."

Mercury's a good car. I had a lot of cars. Different kinds, a lot of different kinds of cars. And that was the kind of car I was driving that day. The girl, she was standing on the side of the street where there was this chicken stand. It wasn't a kernel, but nevertheless it was a chicken stand. And I pulled the Mercury right up there. And I rolled down the window by electric power. She had this leather skirt on. And she had a lot of hair on her arms. I like that, I like that a lot. It means she has a big bush. I like a big bush. She says, are you dating? I said, yeah. She gets in the car. We drive off to this remote location that was comfortable for both she and I. She says, how much do you want to spend? I said, whatever it takes to see your bush, because I know you've got a big one. $25, she says. That's not chicken feed to a man like me. So I produce the $25. She puts it in her shoe.

Wasn't the guy something like 13 or 15 when he did it? It was 25 years ago. I mean, he probably doesn't even remember.

Why did you say that? Well, to tell the God's honest truth, I sense a miscommunication here or something. I, uh, I told your editor... Oh, geez, I can't remember his name. Al Freeman. Yeah, I told Al that there simply couldn't be any pictures. You see, Carl just won't have his picture taken at all. Anyway, we were under the impression that this was supposed to be just a little story or article or something. Isn't that right, Martin? Well, I don't know. I guess... A little article? I mean, I guess so. I mean, it's a story for a very big... Well, it's a newspaper, but it's a very big newspaper. I mean, Carl's very sensitive about the way he looks. He doesn't like to be stared at. He told me one time that if a picture was made of him, it would be permanent proof that he was ugly. He told me that one time. There was a man named John Liggett Hunter who was in the filling station business, and it was a good filling station business, but he was one of these young men we run across in life. I'm sure you run across him, who did not deserve what he had. Like his wife, Sarah. Beautiful. She was at Georgia Peach. In fact, she was more like the picture I had in my mind of a woman than anyone I had ever met. So I took it upon myself to take her away from John Liggett Hunter, who did not deserve her. Oh, I don't know if I mentioned it, but he was a Frenchman who claimed to be an Englishman. Mm. Took a lot of strong nylon cord to get her away from him, because she was a fighter as well as being at Georgia Peach. Anyway, I told your boss to send a man, and he won't talk to a woman. I'm pretty goddamn insulted. Look, I'm a very good interviewer, so why don't you just put me in a room with Carl, and we'll see how many questions he answers or doesn't answer. Shovel just makes too goddamn much racket. He hasn't talked to a woman in 25 years. You'll be the first woman he's talked to in 25 years? I thought that you said he wouldn't talk to me. I don't think he will, but I'll ask him. Anyway, I guess you'll be the first woman he's had the opportunity to refuse to talk to in 25 years. You spend your whole death trying to get out of the womb, and then you spend your whole goddamn life trying to get back in it, but then when you look at it again face to face, it's just glorious, you know?

1xIuWPSIpnw,716,Switchblade Sisters (1975)," Hi, I'm Jack Hill and this is Trailers from Hell. I'm introducing here Switchblade Sisters, which was a film I made in 1974 or so and has since become a cult classic like so many of my films and The trailer is interesting because it's a very unusual trailer in that it's rather long for a trailer it's almost a kind of a mini film in itself and I've seen it screened a few times at film festivals, and it actually gets applause Yes, Switchblade Sisters I would like to mention that the voice over the narrator for this trailer is my good old faithful Ronnie Gans who I used many many times in creating trailers. He has a kind of a... especially here you can hear what I think of is the way Ron sort of curls his voice on certain words. He has a tone that almost sounds lewd and lascivious even lecherous at times. I used him in all my own trailers that I made Their parents didn't want them. Their teachers were scared of them. Even the cops couldn't tame them. This trailer I did not actually cut myself, but I wrote the script for it. Sometimes, especially with trailers, less really is more But if that was a mistake in this case It was because I, the director of the movie that is, just couldn't resist putting in a lot of my favorite moments The actresses in this movie are very interesting the casting is very interesting and The action, the roller rink scene has become a classic scene, another applause-getter at screenings Yet it was shot in just a few hours slapped together and improvised At the time I was really disappointed because I didn't have nearly enough time to do it right Who knows if I had enough time it might not have become a classic Sometimes the spontaneity of things like this can be more interesting than something carefully planned I've had that happen in some other films which I've had to shoot on very very tight schedules Some of the action scenes were just thrown together very quick, become very very popular This is a movie about a gang of girls who kick out the boys take over It was actually distributed for many many years as a lesbian cult film on home video which when I found that out it was a great surprise to me and It was supposed to be actually a little bit political maybe The original title for this film was actually the Jezebels which was the name of the girls gang that they chose for themselves When the film first opened under that title the box office was very poor and some of the theater owners were coming back saying They thought that maybe in the advertisements in the paper people were getting it confused with the old movie called Jezebel from the 40s This is a very controversial scene for example in the film where the girl gets raped by the the good bad guy and actually sort of seems to enjoy it and Becomes his girlfriend later, and I took a lot of criticism for that scene But actually the fact is that I stole it right out of the fountainhead Also from the time when I was working in the Philippines when I heard an old lady's talk about getting raped and she says well You know depends on who's doing it So I took a lot of a lot of flack for that and still do it screams today So the film was released and oddly enough has now become a great famous cult classic And I don't really know why switchblade sisters is a story of today and maybe a little bit of tomorrow"

1neY_Zh5mIs,720,Wallace & Gromit: The Best of Aardman Animation (1996)," We got a call from our national film school saying we've got this young student with us who's seen your work, can you come up and talk to him about animation. And this was Nick Park and was working on his student film, a small little film called Grand Day Out. And by that time he'd shot not a lot of it. So we got to know him and we realised as a kind of kindred spirit, you could see from the footage that he'd done, a naturally very gifted animator, understanding of performance. And the school was helping a bit but basically he was left to his own devices so it was taking forever. And actually he came down, we said look come and help us do some morph work, which he did in the summer and we paid him for that, helped him through. And we actually then helped him with his storyboard on Grand Day Out, we helped him edit that. As Channel 4 got going, we helped to make a film called Babylon in the Sweet Disaster series which was produced by a guy called David Hopkins for Channel 4, which is dealing with the nuclear holocaust sort of thing, it's quite heavy stuff. But this film was based around the arms dealing, annual conference of a bunch of arms dealers in their DJs, a big night out and this big political speech and they're about 50 characters and we thought we can't possibly just animate those, he had Golly with us. So actually I tell you what, let's get Nick in, you know that lad we met, get him, he can help out. And we did a deal with the film school, he still hadn't finished by, this was five years into the film school and we said look we'll help Nick finish him, if you can bring his camera down and his sets down, we'll help him finish, if you can help us make this film Babylon. And that was about 1985, we said by the way we've got this series of films at Channel 4, would you like to work on one of those? And Nick was very interested in animals and birds and wanted to do something around a zoo. So he decided to do this film, Preacher Comforts. Was that part of the commission of Jeremy Isaacs? That was part of the commission of Jeremy Isaacs, yes. By this time he was also drawn to a close on Grand Day Out because once he had joined us, by that time we had some model makers, I did quite a lot of his photography, we just helped him through it and gave him a more structured approach to the whole thing. And we ended up putting it into the Oscars, so he had two out of three films in the Oscars, Grand Day Out and Preacher Comforts in 1989 or whenever it was. Sound's running, when you're ready. Oh well the zoos are very important to animals, they're a bit like homes, like nursing homes for poor animals and people like old people. And there's old animals which are dead and people in the wild don't have much to eat so they have to kill their own people to have something to eat. Well it's reasonably comfortable I suppose, this place, but I've been in more comfortable rooms, yes. If you try to compare the situations and the environment that we live in here with the environment that we live in Brazil, there is a big difference. Here you live in a very small place with all the technological advances possible, you have everything sorted out, double glazing, you know, your heating and everything in Brazil, but you don't have space. In Brazil you have space, although you don't have all this technological, you know, double glazing things like that, but you have space and we need space to live, we need space to feel that we are part of the world and not a kind of piece of object in a box. The interesting thing about Creature Comforts, which I'll never forget, again Nick was, he animated kind of straight through, he didn't use a lot of video playback, he just went through it and he says animating that jaguar or that voice, because it was so expressive, not quite the easiest thing he's ever done, but it just flowed out of him, it was so natural, the expression was there. And I can remember we had a very small cutting room at the back of this building, lacing up, we'd obviously heard the mag track, lacing up the mag track, getting the rushes, because he didn't send off to the labs until they had shot a whole chunk of stuff, so it was quite scary, and then kind of syncing it up and realising that this is absolute magic, it just went together so well, it was quite uncanny and realising this is, you know, what he's done here is something very, very special. The impact of Creature Comforts was phenomenal. Kind of a breakthrough, partially because what Channel 4 were doing was putting out animated films for a more adult audience of a different level, a different... It was taken away from the children's bit into a more grown up, more adult sort of thing. More adult, and actually what came out of the woodwork were a lot of extraordinary animators, the Brothers Quay, Joanna Quinn, a whole candy guard, a whole bundle of, a different mode of expression in fact, and it kind of created this, well, like a kind of art form in a sense, completely different approach to what you could do with animation. I miss a lot the food, I miss the fresh meat, you know, because in Brazil we are predominantly carnivores, we are not, you know, vegetarian, and we don't like potatoes, we like meat, and we like fresh meat."

KYbXUWw61ug,893,Mother Night (1996)," Tonight, I would like to ask a common question. Why are we enemies of the Jew? The Jew is both the cause and the beneficiary of our slavery. If we ignore our destiny, he will triumph over us and our future. The Jew thrives in filth and garbage. He spreads disease. He steals our possessions and lusts after our women. He pretends to be a friend of this vikim, and before the unfortunate one knows it, his neck is broken. We are Jew haters because we are proud to be Aryans. It isn't true that we eat a Jew with every breakfast, but it is true that the Jew is slowly eating away at our future. And that is going to change as surely as world supremacy is the birthright of the Aryan race. This has been our W. Campbell, Jr. I am Hitler. Your government will never acknowledge your role as an agent. You come looking for a pardon, they'll deny they ever heard of you. Well, how many people did know what I was really doing? There were three of us. And the third, I'm sorry to say, is dead. Why doesn't the government come forward and say this man you're spitting on is a hero? Your role will remain classified, and Uncle Sam's official position is that you're the scum of the earth. What are you thinking? I'm a Nazi? You wasn't a Nazi. Take a good look at your crowned friends, because you're next. Even if you were a spy, you could never have served the enemy as well as you served us. All the ideals that make me proud of being a Nazi, they came not from Hitler, but from you. God damn you! You're a dead liar! Tell me what you live for, and I will live for that too! The moral here is, you must be careful what you pretend to be, because in the end, you are what you pretend to be."

yUJNZU96iYY,903,Vertigo (1958)," I'm Dan Ireland. Let me say it flat out. The word masterpiece overrated, overused, not in the sense, not in the case of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo. Vertigo, a feeling of dizziness, a swimming in the head. Despite the recent controversy of sight and sounds, Paul, that Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo, overshadowed Orson Welles masterpiece Citizen Kane, Vertigo still stands as one of the great films that was made about obsessive love. Misunderstood upon its initial release in 1958, Vertigo was considered a critical and box office disappointment, but considering the subject matters and the times that were popular in the late 50s, Rock Hudson and Doris Day comedies were coming to light. Vertigo was a love story that was so profound that people really didn't quite know what to take of it. But you know what? What good love story doesn't have a little edge and some tragedy to it? This just was probably about 20 years ahead of its time. The plot is simple. A retired detective with a fear of heights, hence the word Vertigo, is lured into a case where he's set up to follow a beautiful woman whose husband fears she will harm herself. Not only does he mess up and fall in love with her, and who can blame him when the woman is the voluptuous Kim Novak, but he allows her to apparently jump from a mission in San Juan, Batista, and he can't do a damn thing about it because of his fear of heights. So after a six-month stint in an emotional rehab center, he meets a woman who's a dead ringer for his deceased love. What else is there to do but reinvent her as the dead woman herself? And the results are one of the most intoxicatingly romantic films of all time. James Stewart said Vertigo is his favorite performance. He pulls out all the stops to create a man who is so obsessed by love that any and all objectivity is thrown at the window. Kim Novak gives a beautiful understated performance as Madeline and Judy. History has proven that her performance is as central to the film as Stewart's. This is the perfect Valentine for the romantically twisted."
6kCcZCMYw38,904,Rear Window (1954)," This is the scene of the crime. A crime of passion, filmed in a way you have never seen before. And as no one else would dare attempt, but the screen's master of suspense, the producer-director who shocked the world with Psycho. This is the apartment of a man named Jeffries, a news photographer whose beat used to be the world. Right now, his world has shrunk down to the size of this window. He's been watching the people across the way. Nobody seems to pull their blinds during a hot spell like this. He knows a lot about them by now. Too much, perhaps. For instance, down there on the second floor, the woman pacing about, he calls her Miss Lonely Hearts. So lonely that even death seems like a friend. These are the newlyweds, on a honeymoon no one will ever forget. He calls her Miss Hearing Aid, an artist of a very odd and strange art. The songwriter, who plays the same melody over and over again. A genius or insane? This is the traveling salesman and his invalid wife. Out of their arguments and nagging comes a weird kind of love. Miss Torso, the body beautiful, that is, viewed from a safe distance. Those are just a few of my neighbors. First I watched them just to kill time, but then I couldn't take my eyes off them, just as you won't be able to. And you won't be able to take your eyes off the gloomy old man or your eyes off the glowing beauty of Grace Kelly, who shares the heart and curiosity of James Stewart in this story of a romance shadowed by the terror of a horrifying secret. © BF-WATCH TV 2021"

H9eNwZWtAUU,919,"Wizard of Oz, The (1939)"," Total, heart-offering we're not in Kansas anymore. We're off to see the Wizard of Oz. Follow the Yellow Brick Road, time and time again. The Wizard of Oz is coming soon to video and DVD. Shucks, folks, I'm speechless."
3AaSdZvetuY,920,Gone with the Wind (1939)," It's melodramatic stereotypes, racial stereotypes, and yet, you know, those characters, Vivien Lee's character and Clark Gable and Melanie, they're very interesting and there's complexity to them. It smacks of the 19th century, in a way, Victorian melodrama almost. I think that and of course Casablanca are the two high points of the studio system. I think of the commercial studio system. I don't say that the best films ever made come out of Hollywood, but they represent the best of what producers and studios could put together. And I always felt that Selznick didn't really matter, I mean, it didn't matter who directed, but he would have several directors at times. And it was really his imprint on the picture. You still have that magic of old Hollywood and there's something that just unlocks that fantasy part of your brain when you see those images in that film. And it has to do with the production design, it has to do with the matte work, it has to do with his vision, I think, behind that, pushing William Cameron Menzies, pushing Victor Fleming or George Cukor in the beginning or whoever else was directing that picture at the time."
JqQWY8T5nok,921,My Favorite Year (1982)," It was 1954. Television was live. And Benji Stone landed the job of his dreams as a TV comedy writer. Alice, what are we seeing? Alan Swann's movies. It was the year Hollywood's greatest hero swashbuckled his way onto live TV Hello, sir! and into Benji's life. He's blasted. Good God, he's Renfield. I thought he was dead. Swann better be at every rehearsal sober. I thought he was dead. Swann better be at every rehearsal sober. Or it's your neck. They've asked me to stay with you and help you over some of the rough spots. Like showing up? That's one. Another is not passing out. What sort of heroic idiot am I this time? A musketeer idiot. I read that on the airplane. Very funny. Very good. I wrote that. Did you? Bravo, Stone. Bravo. How do I go to the store, love? We'll be two for dinner. Oh, no, Mr. Swann, this is exactly the way it started last time. And, you know, I'm supposed to watch you. Go ahead, watch this. Now, all we have to do is to get from here to there. I'm going down now. Watch your head! Oh, for heaven's sake. Five minutes to air. This is places, people. Sure, this is live television. Live. What are you doing? Speaking, I am leaving. Take it. Well... I'm afraid... of flesh and blood, life-size no larger. I'm not that silly damn hero I never was. To me, you were. You couldn't have convinced me unless you had that courage. Nobody's that good an actor. I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star. Alan Swann may have been the worst person to look up to. But it was the best time Benji ever had. That's what he is for this. My favorite year."
klM1GSJsblQ,922,Sunset Blvd. (a.k.a. Sunset Boulevard) (1950)," You see, this is my life. It always will be. There's nothing else. Just us. And the cameras. And those wonderful people out there in the dark. Alright, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up. What is it about fame? It's dazzling, it's distracting, and for the famous it can be dangerous as well. Both the glamour and the tragedy are on lurid, brilliant display in Sunset Boulevard, another masterpiece from the great Billy Wilder. The narrator is a dead screenwriter named Joe Gillis, played by William Holden, who tells the tale of his entanglement with Norma Desmond, a star of the silent era. She's played by Gloria Swanson, who really was a star of the silent era. Used to be in silent pictures. Used to be big. I am big. It's the pictures that got small. Eric Von Stroheim, one of the great directors of the silent era, plays Norma's former director, who is now reduced to the role of her manservant. It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem. I could have continued my career. Only I found everything unendurable after she had left me. The fourth major character is Norma's house on Sunset Boulevard. A grand mansion with huge staircases, a ballroom, a screening room, an empty swimming pool, overgrown gardens. It's stuffed with mementos of Norma's former glory, and it serves as an expression of her bottomless narcissism. How could she breathe in that house so crowded with Norma Desmond's? It's as if she's stopped time. Sealed off from the outside world, she remains a young, beautiful starlet in the prime of her career. DeMille always said I was his greatest star. When did he say it, Norma? And this is what Hollywood does. It takes real moments, even whole people, and freezes them forever in time. There's Norma Desmond. Norma Desmond. Norma Desmond. Why, I thought she was dead. How nice to see you. Welcome home, mister. You remember me, don't you? This creates beautiful, beguiling images, but when the images are confused with reality, the results can be pathetic, grotesque, even deadly. Time passes, beauty fades, people grow old, and the only escape is in the movies. The stars are ageless, aren't they?"
Fi2L2MCXglA,923,Citizen Kane (1941)," Rosburt. Citizen Kane is the most important, greatest American film as far as I'm concerned. This is the gold standard here. It's pretty hard to top Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made. Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper? I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of. There's never been a film that I'm aware of that if you watch it for the 138th time, you can still see something new that you hadn't noticed before. I made no campaign promises because until a few weeks ago, I had no hope of being elected. Now, however, I have something more than a hope. And Jim Geddes, Jim Geddes has something less than a chance. Every single, not just every scene, but every shot has an idea. There's a concept and an idea being executed at every second of that film. You look at Citizen Kane and it's this huge movie. The dynamics of that character that he plays are gigantic. Hello, Jenna Dian. And yet, it's such a personal story. Hello, Charlie. I didn't know we were speaking. Sure we're speaking, Jenna Dian. You're fired. There's this extraordinary performance which people seem to take for granted. I mean, Orson ages from 25 to 85 in this movie, and he's totally believable in every phase of it. Rosebud. Orson Welles was brilliant. I mean, and that was like his first film and he was 26 years old. It is just one of the great movies ever made, and I think many people are going to agree it's just one of the great American experiences. Throw that junkie. Citizen Kane will always be something that demands attention and respect and admiration for another way of looking at the world through the cinematic eye."

No, not that way. I was looking at her when she was asleep. Quiet, Alex. You were almost as impetuous as before your wedding. You bought me from that episode. Let me arrange this one. You think so?

Your cornea is excellent. Your cornea is terrific. Love isn't so simple, Ninotchka. Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, the coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers slowly open their petals? Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion. A general warmth in the palms of your hands. A strange heaviness in your limbs. A burning of the lips that isn't thirst, but something a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting than thirst. You're very talkative. The End"
rSeGFCl5fWY,937,Love in the Afternoon (1957)," Yes, in Paris, everybody does it. The butcher, the baker, even the friendly undertaker. Everything about you is perfect. I'm too thin, and my ears stick out, and my teeth are crooked, and my neck's much too long. Maybe so, but I love the way it all hangs together. Nine o'clock. No, that's much too late. Five o'clock. Four o'clock. In the afternoon? When do you work? Whenever I'm not busy. Harry Cooper. Fabulous as the world's greatest connoisseur of women, who has hunted the species from Stockholm to Siam. No wonder he was named Man of the Year. His matchless technique always begins with gypsy music, keyed to fascinate any woman. Audrey Hepburn. Delightfully, completely innocent. How can anyone blame her for being dazzled? Maurice Chevalier. The most famous love detective in Paris, who kept a back score on every game that was ever played. He's certainly the most handsome man in your files. He's certainly the most utterly no good. He's got such an American face, like a cowboy or Abraham Lincoln. You know what happened to Lincoln? And right in the middle of a performance. Love in the afternoon, when a girl with no experience turns the tables on the most experienced man in the world. How many other men were there?

Instead of getting married at once, it sometimes happens, we get married at last. She was raised to raise eyebrows, but Gigi more enjoyed raising the roof. Since the world began, a woman or a man has never been as happy as we are tonight. It's a gay and taunting Paris that takes love so seriously and marriage so lightly. And what is a picture about gay Paris without Marie Chevalier? He had once been the twinkle in grandmama's eye. We met at nine. We met at eight. I was on time. No, you were late. Ah yes? I remember it well. You must be carefree. Devil may, devil may care. Be gay, extravagant, outrageous. Gigi is dedicated to your zestful entertainment. A feast for your heart and senses in eye-thrilling cinemascope and metro color, lilting with the exciting melodies of learner and low. Save a prayer for me tonight. I'll need every prayer. I'm so glad that I'm not young anymore. Oh Gigi, while you were trembling on the brink, was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star? Oh Gigi. Thank heaven for little girls. Thank heaven for them all, no matter where, no matter who. Without them, what would little boys do? Thank heaven for little boys."

uVpB6qJSgH4,943,"Ghost and Mrs. Muir, The (1947)"," Hi, I'm Axel Carolyn and this is Trailers from Hell. I'm here to talk about The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, a movie that I discovered when I was a child. At the time I couldn't watch horror movies because my parents wouldn't let me. So when my dad decided to show us The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, a movie from the 40s, I was only excited because I heard the word ghost, but I didn't expect this to be a romance. So I don't quite remember how I felt about the movie as a child, but I know that 20 years later when I wrote my first short film The Last Post and then my first feature Soulmate, somehow, even though I hadn't seen the movie in all those years, a lot of this inspiration came through. And for my short film, the ending is very much inspired by this movie. And for my feature Soulmate, the storyline seems so very clear that it's inspired by the same movie. And some elements are the same, some lines come back. The tone is very different, but it was very much a clear inspiration for me. So this is The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. So The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is adapted from a book by Josephine Leslie, who wrote under the pseudonym R.A. Dick, which is fun because it seems like she wanted to be seen as a man to publish the book, which is exactly what happens in the film where the lead character writes a book and then has to make it look as if it was the man who'd written it so that she can sell it, which shows a little bit of the sexism of the time. It was very well received at the time, the critics loved the movie. The film is also nominated to an Oscar for Best Cinematography, which is very clear because there's amazing shadow plays in the film, the work of light is amazing. But also the staging is quite fantastic. It's remarkable that it's just those two characters throughout the entire movie, the ghost and the lead actress. And the way they move, a lot of the scenes are shot in just one big setup, and they just move constantly and they constantly make it entertaining and interesting to watch. The cast is particularly wonderful. Obviously, Rex Harrison and Jean Tierney, the entire film relies on their chemistry. They're both extremely charming, they're witty, they're instantly likeable. She's a very strong woman in the way that we define it today. She's very independent. She doesn't let other people make decisions for herself, especially not men. And so there's a whole romance element to it, but it's very, very subtle and underplayed and beautifully rendered through dialogue that's just sparkling throughout the entire film. It was one of Joe Mankiewicz's first movies. He had already directed Dragonwick with Jean Tierney, who also introduced a little-known actor called Vincent Price. And he would go on to direct classics such as All About Eve. One of the things that are kind of amusing to see throughout the movie, like here we can see that the ghost appears on the train. The rules of the ghost are never extremely clearly defined. You never really know if he's stuck in the house or if he can just appear outside. Sometimes he shows up in the forest, sometimes he shows up in London. You never quite know what's going to happen and who is going to see him. And sometimes some elements that we can hear are not heard by some of the actors. But it all works pretty well. It doesn't really matter too much in the movie. The film itself can be interpreted as a metaphor for all kinds of different things. When I was a kid, I think I mostly saw it as a sign of hope, because at the end he appears and he takes her with him when she dies. Re-watching it recently, I thought it was a metaphor for time passing and for life choices and for not messing up your life, which was a lot darker. Again, it's a film that feels very personal and very beautiful."
fU535-dJjso,945,Top Hat (1935)," [""The Star-Spangled Banner""] Don't these people know we're in the middle of a depression? Of course they do. Top Hat, starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, epitomizes Hollywood's remarkable ability to confront misery with good cheer. It's the fourth of the ten collaborations between these two stars, and one of their lightest and most joyful. When a clumsy cloud meets a fluffy little cloud. Astaire plays Jerry Travers, an American who lands in Europe. Is he there on business or on pleasure? It's hard to say, and it's not clear really what the difference would be, but one thing is clear. He is there to dance. [""The Star-Spangled Banner""] Now not everyone is delighted and entertained, at least not at first. Ginger Rogers plays Dale Tremont, who's downstairs in the midst of this barrage of tapping, and who registers a complaint with the hotel management. And then she falls in love with Jerry. Peek-a-boo. But of course it's not that simple. On the way to true love, there are hilarious complications and obstacles. There's a case of mistaken identity. There's a high-strung Italian dressmaker. I am no man. I am Bedini. There's a philandering American husband and his cynical wife. And there's a butler. Possibly we had been a little imprudent, sir. The dialogue is as fizzy and dry as fine champagne. The clothes are impeccable, a stares tie and tails, and especially Ginger Rogers' gowns and even her pajamas. But what would you expect? This is a movie that takes its name from a hat. Top Hat glides from London to Venice, but really it never leaves the soundstage. But this is part of the movie's charm. It doesn't take place in the real Europe of 1935, which was shadowed by war and fascism and economic disaster. It takes place in a dream world full of high balls, elegant hotel suites, lavish floral arrangements, and the unforgettable songs of Irving Berlin. It's not that these songs provide a soundtrack. It's more that they capture just what it is that this movie is about. It's amazing that something so completely artificial should feel so authentic. And the secret to this is in the dancing. Jerry and Dale have to navigate through a maze of mistaken identities and confusions, but once they're on the floor, on the dance floor, moving together, their true identities come into blossom, and we are transported into a realm of absolute joy."
zaC2bWF60A8,946,To Be or Not to Be (1942)," Hi, I'm Joe Dante for Trailers from Hell. A while ago, Trailers from Hell guru Edgar Wright held another one of his series of screenings at the New Beverly Theatre in Los Angeles. Edgar's done a number of these series, as have I. And this time, the subject was pictures that Edgar had never seen. And one of them was one of my favorites, To Be or Not To Be. And it was very interesting sitting watching this 70-year-old movie with a packed house laughing their asses off. It played like Gangbusters. And it just reminded me that you really haven't seen a comedy until you've seen it with an audience. This is a brave, angry film at heart, and a great one. You can see that this aimless trailer is struggling to sell a hot potato. Not only was the star, the brilliant Carol Lombard, dead, killed in a plane crash two months before the premiere, but the subject matter, a comedy about a Warsaw Shakespeare troupe using their vainglorious talents to foil the occupying Nazis, was considered to be an impossibly bad taste. America had entered the war while the film was in production, and jokes about the Gestapo and concentration camps were pretty shocking to 1942 audiences. But Lubitsch juggles the comic and tragic elements perfectly. He had written the lead role of that great, great Polish actor, Joseph Tura, especially for Jack Benny. And he's amazing as is Lombard. Sigruman has his greatest role as the alternately funny and menacing concentration camp airheart. And the rest of the actors are impeccably cast, especially Stanley Ridges as a double agent, Professor Stoletzky, and Lionel Atwell as a ham actor. Mel Brooks remade this in 1983, but it lacks the ballsy immediacy that makes the Lubitsch version so impressive. This trailer aside, there's only one to be or not to be."

0FRLeYaut3o,1077,Sleeper (1973)," Excuse me, Mr. Allen? Is that your new movie you're working on? This? No. I'm a clarinet player in 1973. I go into the hospital for a lousy operation. I wake up 200 years later and I'm Flash Gordon. What's the name of the film? The name of the film is Sleeper. Basically it's an intellectual film. Most of the scenes in it are of a cerebral, almost didactic nature, and there's very little overt comedy in the film. What type of role do you play? I play a generally calm, subdued, in-control leading man. It's a dignified role. You're the alien! You won't get me away, will you? You're a nice person. No! I know I'm not. I know I'm not. I know I'm not. I know I can count on you. What's Sleeper about? Sleeper is a highly charged, emotional love story that's tender and romantic. I hate you! I hate you! Try not to get upset. But he's between myself and Diane Keaton. I'm Luna! Luna! Remember? Luna! Your name is not Luna, is it? I chose Diane because she's a very beautiful actress. I wanted to make use of the natural qualities in her face. She's kind of graceful and there's a certain animal intelligence about her that we utilize throughout the film. It's hard to believe that you haven't had sex for 200 years. 204 if you count my marriage. There's no violence in the film at all. It's a quiet, easy piece of family entertainment. Will there be a special price for children? No but anyone accompanied by an incoherent person gets him for half price. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in Sleeper, a love story about two people who hate each other 200 years in the future."

We'll act as your shield in the event of trouble. No! We missed him. There are a great many things we have to offer your country.

All right. Let's pick him up. Fielding Mellish goes on trial tomorrow for fraud, conspiracy to overthrow the government, and using the word thighs in mixed company. Who else is in the film, Bananas? Carlos Montalban, David Ortiz, and Miguel Suarez. Are there any unknowns? Louise Lasser. Hi. Oh, yes. I've never heard of her. I love you. I love you. Oh, say it in French. Oh, please say it in French. I don't know French. Oh, please. Please. What about Hebrew? Well, Howard Cosell is in the picture, who is, as you know... Who is he? Howard's one of the great, great dramatic actors who comes from the Elizabethan stage. And I think I see the door beginning to open. El Presidente may be coming out. What do you think of Bananas? Is it a good picture? Is it a fair picture? Is it an excellent picture? Where would you rate it? How many stars would you give it, for instance? Well, there's no question. It's my bid for a masterpiece. The picture's an epic. It's monumental proportions. It's moving. It's rich. It's tense. It's taut. It's a great picture. Phil Agreed, Gossamer. It's a cheap little exploitation film, basically. We're going to show some pornographic movies. You need an asher? How do you think it's going to do with the box office?

UiGY9JrZQSc,1084,Bonnie and Clyde (1967)," One of the things that Beatty did as a friend was persist. When he sent me the script, I said, gee, I don't think so. I don't really want to do a film about a couple of bums, essentially. And he said, no, come on. Come on. You can do it. And we can make it something better than that. He was a real friend. He kept at me. He kept at me. And finally, I said, OK. And when I said OK, then I really threw myself into it. And then I said, wait a minute. Let's talk about it. Let me talk to Benton and Newman. And I began to talk to Benton and Newman. And I began to realize that I had a lot of associations with Bonnie and Clyde. I remember, as a kid, seeing their photograph on the front page of the newspapers. I remember the talk about them. I mean, it was not particularly vivid, but I remembered them as figures. More importantly, I remembered the time. I remembered the depths of the Depression. And so I was able to bring that aspect to the film. I said to Benton and Newman, we've got to set this, essentially, in a much more detailed way inside the Depression. If it's not embedded in the economic Depression, it doesn't make sense. That's the system. What I became was the proponent of embedding it in a time and place, in a time and place. And I put in that scene with the farmer, where the farmer's house has been foreclosed by the bank. Because it was part of the absurdity, the economic absurdity of the times, that the banks kept foreclosing on these mortgages to the point where the banks were bankrupt themselves. And it was a kind of eating your own entrails, you know? And so the logic of the film began to emerge, which is, and so perhaps a certain kind of appropriate behavior in a circumstance as insane as this loop is, is to take action. Little did I know that it was going to resonate into its own time. I mean, that was exactly where we were in the 60s, so that I think people associated and brought to that situation an analogous situation in their own lives. I mean, resist the draft, resist the war in Vietnam, break out of these kind of constrictive mores, have a sexual revolution. And in effect, it just happened to be appropriate to that time. So, I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do. I think that's the kind of thing that we're going to do."

pPi8EQzJ2Bg,1090,Platoon (1986)," In 1967, Oliver Stone was a combat infantryman in Vietnam. He was wounded twice and received a medal for gallantry in action. Ten years later, he was a Hollywood screenwriter and the winner of an Oscar. But even after many successes, Stone still had another story to tell. A movie that grew out of his own experience. Stone has come a long way from Vietnam. But he has not left it behind. I'm a little bit of a joker too. Although I might be laughing loud and hard. Deep inside I'm blue. So take a good look at my face. You'll see my smile looks out of place. In the close, it's easy to chase the tracks of my tears. The first real casualty of war is innocence. The first real movie about the war in Vietnam is Platoon."

DDE9kXwG0fs,1093,"Doors, The (1991)"," Hello, this is Alan Arkush and this is Trailers from Hell. Psychedelic movies. Not a big genre, but one that I like a lot. What are they? Well, to paraphrase a definition of psychedelic music, it's any movie you watch under the influence of psychedelics. While there's truth to that definition, let's broaden it a bit to movies that are surreal, dreamlike, not encumbered by earthbound logic. They often contain layered and abstract images and mostly redolent of the 60s. I've seen more than my share and I have here a list of my favorite psychedelic movies and at the top of the list is of course Fellini's Eight and a Half, which is at the top of almost any list about movies that I have. Giulietta the Spirits. Fellini-esque is synonymous with this genre. Olsen and Johnson's Hell's a Poppin talk about surreal and unpredictable. And as a brief aside, I once screened a double bill of Eight and a Half and Hell's a Poppin for Jerry Garcia and the Roadies from the Grateful Dead. The mind reeled that night, literally. When there's Powell and Pressburger's visually sumptuous time-space-bending stairway to heaven and naturally Roger Corman's The Trip, the title says it all, and then there is Koyana Squatzee, Chappaqua, You Are What You Eat, Fantasia, Psych Out, the Pink Elevance on Parade sequence from Dumbo, Porky and Wackyland, and the lysergic fable The Sunshine Makers. And a movie that by any definition is psychedelic. My trailer from Hell, Oliver Stone's The Doors. The Doors movie is a guilty pleasure for me. Back in the day, I saw the band perform about a half-dozen times. Extraordinary concerts. So I used this movie like a cinematic way back machine. Val Kilmer is Jim Morrison. He channels his walk and talk and performs all his own vocals and the live numbers with such perfection that it's impossible to tell if it's the real Jim or not. The live numbers are great. Oliver Stone's staging is among the best in any rock movie ever. That said, this is a somewhat delirious musical bio with scenes that border on camp. The writing of Light My Fire is as corniest and as stilted as a 30s movie, but that doesn't stop me from laughing with the light when it all comes together at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go. There are many layered images, recreations of acid trips that morph into recording sessions and exploding galaxies above the sunset strip. The first half of the movie is the most fun. Typical of a music bio, The Rise is much more interesting than The Fall. The surviving Doors hated the movie, but the spirit and excess of the rock and roll lifestyle are all here. So if you're in the mood for some psychedelia, take a trip with The Doors."

4wBUnziyPWQ,1095,Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)," Hi, I'm Irene Dunn and you're at Trailers from Hell. Now we're going to look at the trailer for a remarkable movie, but I must first issue a warning. If you're offended by profanity or foul language, you should turn me off right now. Okay? Are you still there? All right. We're going to look at the trailer for the movie of Glengarry Glen Ross. I just watched this the other day again, and it was so good that I actually, like, wrote stuff down. There's a story that was originally about another playwright, but it was adapted into the homeless man on Broadway who approaches a fellow and says, may I have 25 cents for a cup of coffee? And the fellow says, neither a borrower nor a lender be William Shakespeare. And the homeless man replies, eat shit and die motherfucker, David Mamet. This is because Glengarry Glen Ross has extraordinary dialogue, actually dazzlingly brilliant poetic dialogue, but it's laced with profanity. Jack Lemmon referred to the play as Death of a Fucking Salesman. This is a great piece of work, and I'm going to have to read this because I want to be respectful. The play Glengarry Glen Ross by American playwright David Mamet was first performed at the National Theatre in London in 1983. Its U.S. debut was the following year in Chicago before it moved to Broadway, where it won lots of Tonys and was a big hit and got the Pulitzer Prize. I think Joe Montagna played Ricky Romano, and he got a Tony as best actor. That's the part played by Al Pacino in the film. The movie version is from a screenplay by David Mamet based on his play, beautifully directed by James Foley. It was released by New Line in 1992. And remember, New Line in 1992 was still Freddie's Nightmares. That's before Lord of the Rings. It was not a box office success. It's hard to say. It's Freudian. Which is a shame because it features one of the greatest ensemble cast in the history of American film, all performing dazzlingly well together and bringing out the poetry in Mamet's extraordinary dialogue. Stunning photography by Juan Riz Aquea. I'm ashamed I don't know who that is. And director Foley's idea of having it constantly reign. It creates a heightened reality in which the theatricality of the material is actually enhanced in high style. This is a great film, a truly great film, with astonishing work from an amazing cast. Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Jonathan Price, and in a terrific scene that Mamet added to the play, Alec Baldwin as a particularly vicious prick. I'm taking so long telling you this and I'm reading all this because I really feel this is a great film. And I really want you to see it. The trailer, however, is amusing if you've seen the film and boring and disappointing if you haven't. Clearly it didn't sell. They didn't know what to do with this movie, obviously. James Newton Howard wrote a great jazz score for the picture. And the trailer cutter even fucks that up. What they do is they cut it like a thriller, like a caper movie. Which it really isn't. But it's an extraordinary film. I really urge you to see it. It's just the acting is of a caliber that's amazing. So let's watch this ill-conceived trailer for Glengarry Glen Ross. Let me have your attention for a moment. Put that coffee down. Let's talk about something important. Because we're adding a little something to this month's sales contest. As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac El Dorado. You want to see second prize? Second prize is a set of steak knives. You can see they're setting this up as a caper and a thriller. But things are taken out of context. They just keep cutting to lines pulled from here and there to generate some kind of false tension. Which is unnecessary because the tension in the piece is powerful. You can get a glimpse of how stylized and beautifully photographed. You think you're a thief? We're just talking. We are? Yeah, we're just speaking about it. Speaking about it is an idea. We're not actually talking about it. No, it's a robbery. It's a robbery? No. What is it we're so afraid of? All you need, a little boost. Tonight is the thing. So be it. It's disconcerting how young everyone is. But these guys at the top of their game, this is truly a great film. I wish the trailer did a better job. I made a documentary a few years ago about used card salesman called Slasher. Which deals with many of the same themes as Glengarry Glen Ross. It's the great American tragedy, the salesman. Or as Lemon said, death of a fucking salesman. This is a great film and I strongly urge you to see it. Glengarry Glen Ross. This is how we keep score, boobie."

I'm going to introduce to you a character I've loved for many years. Strangely enough, when you first meet him, you're going to loathe the very sight of him. He's mean and grasping.

1dWq360_T-I,1103,Rebel Without a Cause (1955)," I'm Alan Arkish and this is Trailers from Hell. Every once in a while a movie comes along that makes a big change in the culture. Today's movie, Rebel Without a Cause, from 1955 made that kind of change. It changed the way that we saw teenagers. Let's take a look. James Dean burst upon the screen with this movie as this trailer reminds us, with no subtlety. He had previously been in East of Eden with Elia Kazan. Kazan and the director of Rebel Without a Cause, Nicholas Ray, had worked together in theater in New York. This movie really is the birth of teen angst. In the scene in the police station with his father, played by Jim Backus, we see with this one set of dialogue lines the birth of the teenager as we see him in movies today. You're tearing me apart! What? You say one thing, he says another and everybody changes back again! When James Dean says you're tearing me apart, we really believe him. Natalie Wood, his co-star, received an Oscar nomination. She too had a dysfunctional family. Sal Mineo, who played their friend, also was Oscar nominated, as was the screenplay, which was written by Nicholas Ray. Ray directed such classics as In a Lonely Place and Johnny Guitar. He really knows how to use widescreen. His compositions are always bold. I think a lot of his compositional sense came from his years studying architecture, what Frank Lloyd wrote. What's odd about the trailer is they don't show two of the most famous scenes in the movie, but seem to center on dysfunctional family relationships. A foolish decision not to wreck your whole life! In ten years you'll never know this even happened. Answer her! Stand up! I mean, when was the last time you saw Judge Hardy being slapped around by Andy Hardy? One of the things that most affected me about this movie is the angst that I felt in my family was something now being portrayed on the screen, and I think that was one of the things that made this movie special. The fact that it had a realism to it. I think a lot of that was brought to the picture by Ray. Everyone's performance is excellent. As a little side note, he had an affair with Natalie Wood. This movie is as good today as it was when it was made in 1955. In fact, I highly recommend watching it with your teenagers. I know I did."

jJgyaFyeqRs,1128,"Fog, The (1980)"," I'm Mick Garris and this is Trailers from Hell. The first movie job I ever had was answering phones for a little company called Star Wars Corporation in 1977. That led to me doing an interview show on the Z Channel, which was a pay TV channel here in Los Angeles in the early days, which in turn led to me doing specialized publicity for a company called Avco Embassy, which is where I met Joe Dante, David Cronenberg, John Carpenter. The very first movie I worked on was John Carpenter's The Fog and that's what I'd like to talk about today. John Carpenter's The Fog. This is KAB Antonio Bay. Stevie Wayne here. And let me be the first to wish Antonio Bay a happy birthday. We're 100 years old today. And keep a watch out for that fog bag. John Carpenter's fourth feature film after Dark Star, Assault on Precinct 13 and Halloween, The Fog is an old-fashioned ghost story. After the huge success of Halloween, $50 million on a $300,000 budget, the follow-up for him was very very important. Avco Embassy gave them a million dollars to make The Fog and though it wasn't the blockbuster that Halloween was, it was successful enough to continue the career trajectory that Halloween had launched. It did about $10 million in its initial release. Halloween made the film press sing his praises though as the new Alfred Hitchcock, which was bolstered by the presence of Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of Psycho's Janet Leigh, in the leading role. In The Fog, both Curtis and Leigh are together in the film, a first in their careers. Like I said, it's a classical ghost story and a very different kind of film from Halloween and that was certainly by design. In fact, it was originally intended to be a PG rated, more subtle chiller, patterned after the shadowy 1940s quiet horrors produced by Val Luton. Though that's what John really wanted to make, it was not to be. When they tested the film with an audience, it did not play the way they'd hoped. After decades of more explicit and bombastic horror movies, including Carpenter's own, the subtle chills he'd concocted just did not thrill the 1980 audience. So Carpenter did a reshoot with much more graphic violence and terror, turning it into a real R rated contemporary shocker that connected with a modern audience. The test scores went through the roof. Lots of reasons that the film is interesting though. Carpenter of course did the score himself as he did for Halloween, but this time it seemed to have more of an Italian influence, echoing in some ways the music of Goblin in Dario Argento's films. Special makeup effects whiz kid Rob Boatine did his first work with Carpenter on this film before they collaborated on the game-changing FX extravaganza in 1982's The Thing. As a side note, between the two movies, Boatine did the howling for trailers from Hell's Godfather, Joe Dante. Despite the addition of modern crowd-pleasing explicitness, it remains a very satisfying old-school ghost story whose tone is perfectly set by old John Houseman telling a spooky tale around the campfire in the film's opening. What you can't see won't hurt you, it will kill you. Between midnight and 1, it will find you."

Tengo 23 años y 50.000 pesetas. Y estoy solo en el mundo. Intentaré ser un buen marido para ti y un buen padre para tus hijos. ¡Pues, ya! ¡Qué haces! ¡Aaah! ¡Viteos! ¡Aaah! Tú solo me ofreces muerte.

UJe0RMnf4vk,1192,Paris Is Burning (1990)," I think if I could just be on TV or film or anything, I'd do that instead of the money. Of course I do want the money because I want the luxury that goes with it. But I want to be wealthy. If not wealthy, content, comfortable. You know? I want to be somebody. I mean, I am somebody. I just want to be a rich somebody. Women don't go out of their way because they are women. I went out my way because I was and I felt that I wanted to be the best I could be. This was not a game for me or fun. This is something that I want to live. Hopefully, God willing, by 1988 I fully hope to become a full-pledge woman of the United States. You look at all these models on the wall. Every one of them are gorgeous. Every one of them are beautiful. But every one of them have their own look. This is my idol, Paulina. Someday I hope to be up there with her. If that could be me, I think I would be the happiest person in the world. Just knowing that I can compare to Paulina, to stand next to her and to take pictures with her. I look at her hair and I'd say she's seductive and she's alluring. I look at her there and I say she's sexy and provocative. I look at her hair and I think that she's childish and little girl type. I look at her hair and it's the same. I look at her hair and I think of wicked beauty. That's how I see her. I admire her. The red hot fire of hair and the hobbit."

The 50s went hysterical and broke up to the wild antics of Martin and Lewis. In the great tradition of these laugh masters of the past, come two guys who are hysterically funny. Their Cheech and Chong, the comedy team that gave birth to rock comedy and in the process turned on a whole generation. Now it's time for the Cheech and Chong movie, Up in Smoke. Is that a join man?

And even man's most heavenly plans go... Up in Smoke. We're getting pulled over by the cops, man. What? You don't have a license. You don't have a license?

OLNktcDs05Y,1201,"Good, the Bad and the Ugly, The (Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il) (1966)"," Hello and welcome to Trailers from Hell. My name is Ernest Dickerson and today's trailer is for The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef were back and this time they were with Eli Wallach in one of the greatest westerns ever, Italian or otherwise. One of the things that was so shocking about this movie is that everybody was bad, even our hero Clint, who is a morally ambiguous guy, and he's called The Good. But this time they get involved in the Civil War, working for a law ship in the gold. Now Clint is supposed to be the good of the group, but he's far from a good guy. Lee Van Cleef always played bad guys, so it wasn't a big surprise to see him playing a bad guy here. And then we had Eli Wallach who played Tuco, and he was a bad guy, but he was lovable because he had us just cracking up. He was just so funny. But this was the third in the so-called dollar trilogy by Sergio Leone, the first one being A Fistful of Dollars, the second one being For A Few Dollars More. Sergio was Italian, but he was a student of American films, particularly westerns. He actually worked as an assistant director and a second unit director on Robert Aldrich's production of Sodom and Gomorrah. And he also directed movies like The Colossus of Rhodes with Rory Calhoun before he took a chance and adapted Kurosawa's Yojimbo and made it into a western and turned it into A Fistful of Dollars. Now it was a huge success, and after that came For A Few Dollars More and then this one, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, which a lot of people consider the greatest Italian western ever. This is Leone's best known film and Emi Omorokoni's best known score. You whistle the...and everybody knows exactly where it's coming from. The great thing about Leone films is he always had these in a circular area, three-way duels. He had it at the end of For A Few Dollars More and here it is again. And for him this was the deciding moment, this was when fate came together in the circle. The eyes, when you look at the tip of Lee Van Cleef's finger is missing. It's like great details like that, which made movies like this unlike anything we had ever seen before. Serge Leone, the master. The End."

That film's a love story between those two lads and how they've been... ..coming together, and how they've been... ..kind of the only sense of cohesion or understanding or compassion... ..or companionship in each other's lives.

OvebOqneLIU,1203,12 Angry Men (1957)," You've listened to a long and complex case, murder in the first degree. A premeditated murder is the most serious charge tried in our criminal courts. You're faced with a grave responsibility. Thank you, gentlemen. I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen to have tickets to that ballgame tonight. Yanks and Cleveland. I tell you, we were lucky to get a murder case. Even though it's an open and shut case like this one, have you ever heard so much talk about Milton? I just think he's guilty. I thought it was obvious from the word go. He was born in a slum. Slums are breeding grounds for criminals. I know it and so do you. Who's voting not guilty? Boy, oh boy, there's always one. Those two witnesses were the entire case for the prosecution. Supposing they're wrong. Couldn't change my mind if you talk for a hundred years. What does it mean? The odds are a million to one. It's possible. But not very probable. I mean, they're born liars. Only an ignorant man can believe that. We're trying to put a guilty man in the chair where he belongs. Who tells you that you have the right to play like this with a man's life? You can't send someone off to die on evidence like that. He didn't change his vote. I didn't. One, two, three, four, five.

For over a quarter of a century, controversy has raged around the name of T.E. Lawrence. No man of our time has drawn upon himself so much praise and so much criticism. Lawrence of Arabia. The man torn between two civilizations. Lawrence of Arabia. Filmed against a canvas of awesome magnificence. Lieutenant Lawrence, sir, is not your military advisor. But I would like to hear his opinion. Damn it, Lawrence! Who do you take orders from? From Lord Faisal. In Faisal's tent. Hailing the birth of a new star, Peter O'Toole as Lawrence of Arabia. What was he really like? This controversial figure who became a legend in his own lifetime. He was the man who made the world a better place. He was a very great man. He was a poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior. He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey. What, in your opinion, do these people hope to gain from this war? They hope to gain their freedom. There's one war in every minute. They're going to get it, Mr. Bentley. They're going to get it. They're going to get it. There's one war in every minute. They're going to get it, Mr. Bentley. I'm going to give it to them. Lawrence and Lorraine. Together they made history. Now a gathering of international stars unfolds the story. Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal. The English have a great hunger for desolate places. I fear they hunger for... Arabia. Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayy. I carry 23 great wounds, all got in battle. 75 men have I killed with my own hands in battle. I scatter, I burn my enemies' tents. I take away their flocks and herds. The Turks pay me a golden treasure, yet I am poor. Because I am a river to my people. Jack Hawkins as General Allenby. I believe your name will be a household word. When you would have to go to the War Museum to find who Allenby was. You're the most extraordinary man I ever met. Leave me alone. What? Leave me alone. Jose Ferrer as the Turkish Bay.

And we were doing that little scene and while we were doing it, I glanced across the street, behind the camera I saw Harper and I saw that her cheeks were glistening and I thought, well we're just tearing her up, we're just breaking her heart, we must be marvelous in this scene. So when it was all, Mulligan, the director, took it at one take. He said, don't think you could do it any better. And we didn't either. So I walked over to Harper and I said, Harper, I think I saw some tears on your cheeks. I went out of the corner of my eye while we were playing that scene. She said, oh Gregory, you've got a little pot belly just like my daddy. So we got off to a good start."

Today we're showing you the trailer for Sergio Leoni's Once Upon a Time in the West, which is not only a great film, I worked on it in a very low level. You see me get shot about 12 times. Anyway, this is a wonderful movie. If you haven't seen it, you really should. And the trailer kind of almost shows it. Alright, famous Leoni close-ups. You really should see this on a big screen. Get the impact of these shots of Woody Strode and these iconic American actors, Jack Elam, Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda with those blue eyes. Man, this is a good movie. This is really an interesting movie. You know, they call them spaghetti pictures and operas. And they really are operatic. This is in Almeria, Spain. I'm actually in that scene. This is Claudia Cardinali, breathtakingly beautiful. I don't know what the hell that is. She comes to the West. This is the slaughter of the Irish family with one of the great introductions where you see the bad guys. I think they might show it here. The bad guys coming out of the... Yes, the guy in front is Henry Fonda and those dusters. You do this great pan when the kid runs over. Ooh, Henry Fonda rapes Claudia Cardinali. And of course, being an Italian movie, she digs it. He's a very bad guy. There's Jason Robards with a great mustache. It's funny, this trailer, because it plays on Jack Elam and Woody Strode. They're in the movie like 20 minutes at the most. They set up the beginning and then they're killed. But it's just a terrific film. Huge close-ups. You can see the pancake. Look at that. You can see the makeup there. That may have been me. I don't know. There's Claudia being pushed around again. She liked it. Dead people. I have to tell you, this movie I worked on for almost two months. I was one of what was called the stunt posse. A lot of Italians, some Brits, mostly Spanish. And we got shot a lot, rode horses a lot, and worked with the second unit a lot. But Leonie was just a real character. He wore a cowboy hat and he had little guns. And he spoke just like Chico Marx. And it was wonderful to watch him direct Fonda. He'd say, Anka, what I want you to do. It was like a comedy routine. Boy, how many times can we see that one love scene? This is just a wonderful looking film, too. It's just a very clever picture. Look at the size of that. There I am. And this is Monument Valley. John Ford invented this. No one ever lived in Monument Valley. And now it's a symbol of the American West. And Leonie had to go and shoot some of this in Monument Valley. I wasn't there. I was back in Spain. It's a great film."

The Drama of Absolute Power and the Men Who Violate It. The Godfather, Part II. What is your name? Don Vito Corleone and his son Michael, both had seen the ones they loved most cut down before their eyes. Both had killed as an act of vengeance. Both commanded the most powerful and merciless crime organization in the world. Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the so-called five families in New York? It's a complete falsehood. They would take any measures. When you've won, do you want to wipe everybody out? I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Make any arrangement. Michael, we're bigger than U.S. Steel. Order any death to protect the empire they controlled. The Godfather and his heir, both were men of ice and both were targets. Please fill all the property. Please, please stay inside. Keep them alive. We'll try. Michael, alive! The Godfather, Part II is Sicily in 1921 and Nevada in 1958. It is revolution in Havana and rub-outs in New York. It is manipulation. It would be like trying to kill the president. There's no way we can get to him. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it says you can kill anyone. It is murder and it is murder itself. It is murder and it is betrayal. It was a son, a son, and I had it killed because this must all end. The Godfather, Part II is the final chapter in the violent history of the Corleone crime family. It is the motion picture masterpiece of the year. Thank you for watching."
UuWmCVdwhKg,1222,Full Metal Jacket (1987)," The enemy has very deceitfully taken advantage of the Tet-Sis fire to launch an offensive all over the country. In Saigon, the United States Embassy has been overrun by suicide squads. Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun. We also have reports that a division of NVA has occupied all of the city of Hue south of the Perfume River. In strategic terms, Charlie's cut the country in half, the civilian press are about to wet their pants, and we've heard even Cronkite's going to say the war is now unwinnable. Sir, does this mean that Ann Margaret's not coming? Whose side are you on, son? Our side, sir. Don't you love your country? Yes, sir. Then how about getting with the program? Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win? Yes, sir. Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is to obey my orders as they would the word of God. We are here to help the Vietnamese because inside every gook is an American trying to get out. It's a hardball world, son. We've got to keep our heads until this peace craze blows over."

Some said the man was Salieri. Salieri? Salieri. I don't believe it. All the same. Could it be possible? Did Salieri do it after all? Did he murder Amadeus? Amadeus. The man. The music. The magic. The madness. The murder. The mystery. The motion picture. Amadeus. Everything you've heard is true. You"
SH4OFXlvzKA,1226,"Quiet Man, The (1952)"," I'd like to tell you about the quiet man. He's John Wayne in a picture you'll soon be cheering. It's the story of Sean Thornton, a right-ended man who came from America to forget his past in Innishree. There he met a fiery red-headed lass and the village marriage broker went to work. That's a pretty bonnet you have on. Bonnet? Don't you be talking to me about bonnets. I have to leave in mine stuck up there like a... Easy now. Have the good manners not to hit the man until he's your husband. Unintentionally hit you back. Then her bully of a brother, Red Will Danner, refused to pay her rightful dowry. There'll be no locks or bolts between us, Mary Kate, except those in your own mercenary little heart. Mary Kate left him to go to Dublin, but he caught her at the station and brought her back with the whole town watching him do it. I'll pay you. Never. Then the fight was on, a fight they're still talking about in Innishree. It's a wonderful picture, the finest ever brought to the screen by John Ford, and he's won three Academy Awards. His direction makes unforgettable the performances of John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Barry Fitzgerald, and Victor McLaughlin."
OzlXjvcsM1U,1230,Annie Hall (1977)," Annie Hall appears to be a comedy most of the time. The Diane Keaton figure is so funny and so endearing and so touching that all of us at the time, all of us men, you know, would have loved to meet someone like that and have them in our lives. She was a total free spirit and the film plays on a very surface level as a comedy of manners in the New York of the 70s, but it goes much deeper than that into the fabric of human relationships and what is loved and lost. The original title of Annie Hall was Anhedonia, which is a phrase that means the inability to truly love and be loved. It's like a disease and I guess it is talking mostly about his character in the film, but the fact that he directed it and plays this very believable nebbish character that most of us are, frankly, most of us are nebbishes. You know, we're not the gladiator, we're the nebbish most of the time in our lives. He's the guy we identify with the film. He's suddenly confronted by a force of nature played by Diane Keaton and as he gets more and more involved in her life and falls more and more in love with her, it becomes apparent that he cannot truly live out a love affair and bring it to fruition. And so they go their separate ways in the film and again, like most of the great American films, it's rather bittersweet if not sad that they go their separate ways. But when the film is over, you're elated. It's a huge upper. Why? Because we've experienced a slice of life. We've seen that moment when art crosses over and becomes like real life."

You are way out of line here! I'm out of line? Yes, sir! I'm running this show here! We'll see about that! Aren't we going to the White House, Gus? Nah. No ticker tape parade in New York? And no Jackie? There's another hold from NASA, another delay. What can be going through a man's mind at this point? Gordo, I have to urinate. No. Tell him he cannot. Uh, say listen, old buddy. Uh, they promise we'll stop at the next gas station. They request that you remain in a holding pattern till then. This is the story of the special few at the very top. The elite brotherhood whose achievements inspired a nation and captured the imagination of the world. These are the men who had the right stuff. They all want to see Buck Rogers. And that's us."

bVF0o9S5Ex4,1235,Harold and Maude (1971)," Hi, I'm Dan Ireland. This is Trailers from Hell. I'm a sucker for romance One of the greatest genres growing up was watching May to December romances. I always like to see The younger man and the older woman think Cliff Robertson and Joan Crawford Well imagine my delight when I finally got to see the first January December romance and that belonged to a film called Harold and Maude Harold and Maude was a second film from Hal Ashby after his debut film The Landlord This film I'm sure when it was first screened at Paramount the thought in the room was How the hell are we going to sell this? They didn't know what they had. I remember when the film opened They took out full-page ads and all it said was the names of the characters So that's really what they knew about the movie and it's really a shame that this film had to go through a whole gestation period of four or five years before it finally came to fruition Harold and Maude is one of the most oddball beautiful cult romantic Insanely funny films of the 70s Ruth Gordon Who was probably one of the great screenwriters along with her husband Garson Canaan? Gives a performance that is so beautiful and life-affirming I hate to use that word life-affirming, but I don't know what else to call this movie Ruth Gordon in every single moment in every single frame brings a joy to this and It's about a hundred and eighty degrees away from the film that won her an Academy Award Rosemary's baby Budcourt who was in Altman's Brewster Macleod never had a role that showed his chops like this He's so funny so weird so Completely dark and yet Absolutely knowing in his performance that every time I watch my just I marvel at how good he is It's really ashamed that he was never ever given another role that was like this because he sure could take it on aside from that Harold and Maude finally got its break in 1977 from a company called specialty films I At the time had a theater in Seattle, and I was honored to do The re-premiere of Harold and Maude and it played at our theater for about 20 weeks It was one of the films that I actually went in and watched from start to finish About 20 times and I was also in the projectionist booth running it so that's really saying something It's a film that lingers if you look at the beautiful blu-ray restoration on criterion You'll be blown away that it wasn't shot yesterday It's a film that puts a smile on my face a song in my heart and speaking of songs The amazing cat Stevens scored this film and it still lingers if you haven't seen Harold and Maude to yourself a treat Run out immediately do whatever you have to do, but see Harold and Maude. It's essential and It's one of my favorite films"

acB78SkO80A,1252,Chinatown (1974)," What's wrong? Your eye. What about it? Something black in the green part of your eye. Oh, God. It's a flaw in the iris. A flaw? Yes. The sessord of birthmark. 1930s Los Angeles was a city of mystery and glamour in the midst of transforming itself into a modern metropolis. This historical process provided the backdrop for a lot of classic detective fiction and film noir, and Chinatown, produced by Robert Evans and directed by the infamous Roman Polanski, certainly draws on that tradition. But when you look closely, it's much blacker than even the darkest film noir. Every noir needs a hard-boiled private detective who takes on a seemingly routine case and finds himself embroiled in an elaborate and far-reaching conspiracy. Here it's Jack Nicholson in one of his very best performances as the cynical and resourceful Jake Giddies. Maybe we can put the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay the head of the department for the next few days. Now the plot is much too complicated to go into here, but suffice it to say that Jake, clever though he is and smart as he thinks he is, is always just a half step behind. Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulberry, I think there's been some misunderstanding here. There's no point in getting tough with me. I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Giddies. My lawyer does. Jake gets a little bit of a hard-boiled, but he's a very good detective. I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Giddies. My lawyer does. Jake gets mixed up with Evelyn Mulray, played by Faye Dunaway, wife of the city's water commissioner and daughter of Noah Cross, a very powerful local businessman played by the film director John Huston. Hope you don't mind, I believe they should be served with the head. Both of them are excellent, so is everything else in Chinatown. Richard Silbert's production design, John Alonzo's cinematography, the score by Jerry Goldsmith, and the Oscar-winning script by Robert Town. You accusing me of extortion? Absolutely. I don't think I need a day or two. You're dumber than you think I think you are. The movie is much more than the sum of its parts. The director, Roman Polanski, pushes beyond the conventions of the genre to give us a stark encounter between a powerless individual and monstrous evil. You're a very nosy fellow, kitty cat, huh? You know what happens to nosy fellows? Huh? No? Want to guess? Huh? No? Okay. They lose their noses. This is a theme that Polanski revisits again and again in the course of his career, and it's partly a reflection of his own life. He spent his childhood hiding from the Nazis in occupied Krakow. His wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered in 1969 by the Manson family. Later, a few years after Chinatown, he was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl, a case that continues to shadow him to this day. This is certainly a filmmaker well acquainted with the darker side of humanity. See, Mr. Gits, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of everything. Noah Cross is a great screen villain, but what he represents is something larger and more pervasive than just one man's corruption. Evil is elemental in Chinatown. It's in the air, in the sunshine, in the water. And in the face of it, there's nothing one man can do. Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown."

EQyqvFVe4Y4,1254,"Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The (1948)"," Jobs are worth a dime, but Johnson ain't to be had at all. The streets are full of guys pushing each other. Gold in Mexico? Why, sure there is. Not ten days from here, but a real pack train is a-mountain, waiting for the right guy to come along, discover a treasure, and then tickle it, or she lets him have it. The question is, are they the right guys? Real bananas. There are few and far between. They take a lot of finding. So answer me this one, will you? Why is gold worth some 20 bucks an ounce? I don't know, because it's scarce. A thousand men say go searching for gold. After six months, one of them's lucky. One out of the thousand. This find represents not only his own labor, but that of 999 others to boot. That's 6,000 months or 500 years, scrabbling over mountains, going hungry and thirsty. Now, the gold, mister, is worth what it is because of the human labor that went into the finding and the getting of it. Never thought of it just like that. There's no other explanation, mister. Gold itself ain't good for nothing except for making jewelry with gold teeth. Gold's a devilish sort of a thing, anyway. You start out to tell yourself you'll be satisfied with 25,000 hands from a smacker's worth of it. Say, help my lord and cross my heart. Find resolution. After months of sweating yourself dizzy and growing short on provisions and finding nothing, you finally come down to 15,000, then 10. Finally, you say, Lord, let me just find $5,000. Worth a never-asked-for anything more the rest of my life. $5,000 is a lot of money. Yeah, here in this joint seems like a lot, but I tell you, if you was to make a real strike, you couldn't be dragged away. Not even a threat of miserable death would keep you from trying to add 10,000 more. At 10, you'd want to get 25, 25, you'd want to get 50, 50, 100. Like roulette. One more turn, you know, always one more. It wouldn't be that way with me. I swear it wouldn't. I'd take only what I set out to get. Even if there was still a half a million dollars worth lying around waiting to be picked up. I've dug in Alaska and Canada and Colorado. I was with the crowd in the British Honduras where it made my fare back home and almost enough over to kill me with a fever, that guy. I've dug in California and Australia, all over the world, practically. I know what gold does to men's souls. You talk as though you struck it rich sometime or another pop. How about it? And what are you doing in here, down and outer? That's the gold. That's what it makes us. Never knew a prospector yet that died rich. Make one fortune, shoot a blow it in trying to find another. I'm no exception to the rule. Sure, I'm an odd old bone now, but say, don't you guys think the spirit's gone? I'm all set to shoulder a pickaxe and a shovel any time anybody's willing to share expenses. Rather go by myself. Going alone is the best way. But you gotta have a stomach for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it. On the other hand, going to the partner too is dangerous. Murder's always lurking about. Partner's accusing each other of all sorts of crimes. As long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last. But when the piles of gold begin to grow, that's when the trouble starts. Me now, I wouldn't mind a little of that kind of trouble. I think I'll go to sleep and dream about piles of gold getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Do you believe what that old man who was doing all the talking at the Oso Negro said the other night about gold changing a man's soul so he ain't the same kind of a guy as he was before finding it? I guess it all depends on the man. That's exactly what I say. Gold don't carry any curse with it. It all depends on whether or not the guy who finds it is the right guy. The way I see it, gold can be as much of a blessing as a curse. Hey, uh, Dobbsy. Yeah? Look who's coming out of the Hotel Bristol. Is that Pat McCormick or am I seeing things?"
_TpKN9Tq9aQ,1256,Duck Soup (1933)," Hi, I'm Sig Ruhman and you're at Trailers from Hell. Now we're going to look at the trailer for Paramount Pictures' 1933 release, Duck Soup, starring the four Marx brothers. Yes, this is Zepo's last film. This is the fifth and last Marx Brothers movie made by Paramount. It was written by Burt Kalmar and Harry Ruby with additional dialogue by Arthur Sheikman, produced by Herman Minkiewicz and directed by Leo McCary. This was successful, even though it's always been referred to as unsuccessful, but the Marx Brothers were unhappy with Paramount and they moved to MGM where Irving Fulberg kind of watered them down and they became much more successful. This film was directed by McCary, so there's lots of Laurel and Hardy in it. There's brilliant sequences. I actually think this is possibly the best Marx Brothers film. It's surreal, the politics are extraordinary, it has one of the great endings in motion pictures. And my favorite gag is we find Groucho in bed and he's just covered in Ritz crackers. There are Ritz crackers all over the room. And he's on the phone with Margaret Dumont and she says, I'm coming right over and he has an afterthought. He says, good and bring some cheese. Anyway, this is an extraordinary picture. You wouldn't know from watching this lame trailer, but this is the film Woody Allen used in Hannah and Her Sisters literally as a reason to live."

yGQm50DTOVk,1266,Unforgiven (1992)," This story, it seemed like, was the one I wanted to tell at that particular time in my life. Yeah, it's great that the romanticism that Ford brought and Hawks and all of them brought and the wonderful cattle drives and Red River and the great Anthony Mann westerns that Jimmy Stewart did. I think this one was a chance to just put my stamp on what I felt about it in reality. Like you say, it is a crock. It is a myth. One of my favorite scenes in Unforgiven was to do the scene where Ned and I and Mike, they're all up in the rocks, the three of us, the kid and Morgan Freeman's character, we're all up there and we actually ambush this guy. Here's the guy who is supposedly the lead in the picture and they ambush this guy and then they give him the coup de grace or try to finish him off in this kind of gruesome way. One of them can't stand the idea that he's lost his feeling for blood and William Money sort of has to do it as an animal that's suffering. You can't just leave him suffering. Shoot him. Shoot him. And it kind of stated that that would be more the way it was rather than two guys out in the street and the moon and the sun in the background and the backlighting and the drawing and the film and the hero always waited until the other guy drew first. That can't happen in real life. The hero can't wait until the other guy draws first. I wanted to make a statement that the Western was based upon myth and created by characters who exaggerated the myth of it all. But I also wanted to make a statement that was pertinent to today's society is the way the romanticism of gunplay and of violence. This story seemed to allow for both of those emotions to be explored."

gNXQQbgK_cc,1291,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)," I'm Ty West, this is Trailers from Hell, and I'm going to cap off my most beloved movie franchise trilogy with Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. As much as I was obsessed with Indiana Jones my whole life and how it spurred on my excitement for cinema, this was the first of the films that was actually released when I was of an age that I would be aware of its release, where I saw the previews on TV and I was able to go see the movie in the theater. And I remember going to see the movie in the theater on opening night and it was sold out and I had to sit away from my family. I had to sit in the front left corner in the absolute worst seat in the whole theater. And yet the experience was one of the most rewarding theatrical experiences to this day I've ever had. Because I've never been so excited to see a movie. A movie could have been terrible, it wouldn't have mattered. It was like funneled into everything that I wanted out of a cinematic experience into sort of one night. And I saw it five times in the movie theater and it was really, it was one of the last times that I really felt like this is like what I really go to the movie for and was totally rewarded by that. So this is Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. What's interesting about the fact that this, well this whole series was conceived as a trilogy. From before Raiders everyone had signed on to make three of them. And that's kind of interesting that everyone agreed to do that and then followed through with it and made three pretty great movies. I feel like when everyone signs on to do that many movies everyone's like, ah it'll never happen or they're worried it might not be good. And in this case I think they really sort of maintained it. They're also like these, this is one of the last movies of a time when an epic movie was also an epic movie production. Where it was shot on multiple continents, it was like doing new technological things. It was like a groundbreaking movie in that the making the movie was almost as interesting as the movie itself. And then everyone just figured out you could fake it and then that kind of magic went away. I hate these guys. Anna! Our situation has not improved. There's even, there's like the practical stunts that are in all these films and particularly this movie. I mean even just looking at Harrison Ford's slide like that. I don't know, there would just be a way to do it easier today that they wouldn't do it. And there's a really famous stunt that's in this trailer where he jumps off of a horse onto a moving tank. And it's incredible. It's like this one shot of a stunt man literally just risking his life to land this stunt. And it's coming up here. Look at that. That's amazing. And you would just never do it. It would be green screen and wire work and you paint out the wires. And it's fine but it doesn't have that sort of organic life to it that when you knew people were actually doing things. This was also the first movie I watched a making of for. And they went into the sound design and they talked about how they use lion roars to make the waves. And so this was the first movie that I started to understand what sound in movies was and post-production sound and sound design. And to this day sound design is a huge part of the filmmaking process for me and I think it's because of that making of. Have the adventure of your life. Keeping up with the Joneses."
Mo_WilWo9LY,1292,Being There (1979), This is Alan Spencer for Trailers from Hell. Many people believe Peter Sellers was the greatest comic actor that has ever been committed to celluloid or has ever been committed. I tend to agree with them. Comedy doesn't get a lot of respect and he got two best actor nominations including one for this movie which is probably the greatest role of his career. It was his dream to do this and it's a dream to watch. Being There. I'm Chance the gardener. The gardener? Yes. Since I was a child I worked in this garden. Then you really are a gardener. Oh yes. Being There gave Peter Sellers the greatest challenge of his career. Playing a simpleton whose entire knowledge of the world comes from TV. He's not playing a network executive but a gardener named Chance. And he's also got to project a veneer that's misinterpreted by intelligent people like Shirley McLean that he's very wise. No easy task but this is Peter Sellers. After reading Yerzey Kuzinski's satirical novella Being There Sellers became obsessed with playing Chance the gardener called Chauncey Gardner thanks to malapropism. It would send the author notes signed Chance as well as show up to his house and garden in character to show he could pull this off. Sellers related to Chance as he viewed himself as a cipher a blank page. Nevertheless it would take years before Sellers had the clout to bring Being There to the screen and when he did he selected Hal Ashby as director. Sellers revered Ashby's Harold and Maude and Being There features some tonal similarities with long static shots and uncomfortable pauses. The film doesn't possess the usual rhythms of a comedy. Before filming began Sellers struggled to find the soulless soul of his characterless character. Sellers was a master impressionist who'd often mimic people he met like a human tape recorder stockpiling voices for future use. For the movie Where Does It Hurt he played his entire part talking like Robert Vaughn. During the filming of Murder by Death he punked Neil Simon by pretending to be Alec Guinness on the phone asking him to recommend hookers. For Chauncey Gardner Sellers took the voice of Stan Laurel and flattened it out but you can still hear traces of Laurel when he says goodbye Louise and that's a very good idea Ben. Physically Chauncey couldn't look gaunt so Sellers put on weight which was dangerous because he had heart problems. He also reportedly had a little plastic surgery which was even more risky because he had a pacemaker but Sellers viewed Being There as his pinnacle. When he finished the film he stated he had no more goals in life. Sellers and Ashby got along fine but Sellers was livid with the director for including a blooper reel during the closing credits. Sellers felt it broke the spell of his performance and cost him an Oscar. I've seen the original version which showed TV static and it's much better. You wouldn't want to see outtakes of John Hurt taking off his elephant man makeup. Sellers died a year after Being There was released. He'd consider getting a heart transplant deserve one more than Dick Cheney. The last line of Being There is life is a state of mind. Those same words are inscribed on Peter Sellers grave.

From its humble beginnings in the local garages and basements in the Pacific Northwest, to its chart-topping debut on the worldwide scene, hype chronicles what became known as the grunge phenomenon. I think we all became aware that there was a certain regional sound developing. We just got a phone call at the studio one day from this guy, Kurt. He just came up, blew out ten songs in five hours. We recorded them and mixed them in one afternoon and blew me away. Straight from its 1997 theatrical release, hype describes how talent and the media frenzy sold the world on the Seattle sound. The effect of this whole thing of like hyping a label or hyping a sound or hyping a place, is it starts to take a lot of the attention away from the individual artists that are making music. And you start realizing, well there's a whole lot of people out there making money by selling the idea of the Seattle scene or grunge or whatever. Hype also features rare performances and interviews with the Fastbacks, the Melvins, Mudhoney, the Poseys, Seven-Year Bitch, Seaweed, Super Suckers, Young Fresh Fellows and many more.

FasbBkzbnNE,1315,Paris Was a Woman (1995)," Gertrude Stein came to Paris in 1903 to join her brothers Leo and Michael. As the Stein family built up the world's first collection of modern art, Gertrude began to write in earnest. Gertrude Stein, rich in enthusiasm but modest in means and then about as unknown as a writer as Picasso was as a painter, began her famous and eclectic Picasso collection. For her first Picasso she and her brother Leo paid 150 francs and all three quarreled about the picture's merits. It was an early exquisite conventional nude. Miss Stein, who was already ripe to prefer stranger sights in art, thought the girl looked classically flat-footed. From 1906 to 1909 the Stein family controlled the Picasso output since no one else wanted it. Janet Flanner, an American in Paris. As Gertrude and Leo's collection grew people called at 27 Rue de Fleureux to see the curious paintings. These gatherings developed into an informal Saturday night salon at which Matisse and Picasso were frequent guests. Picasso in particular loved the international flavor and sexual ambiguity of the evenings. Then in 1907 Gertrude Stein met Alice B. Toklas"

lCxR7dlavwg,1333,"Birds, The (1963)"," How do you do? My name is Alfred Hitchcock and I would like to tell you about my forthcoming lecture. It is about the birds and their age-long relationship with man. It will be seen in theatres like this across the country. In my lecture I hope to make you all aware of our good friends, the birds. Theirs is a noble history and through it all man has played a conspicuous part. This cave drawing is one of man's earliest sketches of his feathered friend. One can see at once the loving care with which the artist depicted his subject. The story of man and his friends, the birds, is filled with many fine examples of ways in which these noble creatures have added to the beauty of the world. Take this plumed hat from the period of Charles I. How proud the birds must have been to have their feathers plucked out to brighten man's drab life. Here we have a later model, a refinement of the first. A man, or rather woman, thought enough of the birds to have an entire one as a decoration. It's quite dead of course. Naturally, the egg plays a very prominent part in my lecture. Not a word about which came first, however, I don't believe in dealing with controversial matters. Thousands of years ago, man was satisfied merely to steal an egg from a nest and use it for food. Now he has perfected this process by imprisoning each hen in a separate cage and by scientifically manipulating the lights so that she doesn't fall into the rut of the old 24-hour day. Thus, he can induce the bird to reach fantastic heights of egg production. Originally, there were many varieties of birds on earth. Some have become extinct. The great orc, the passenger pigeon, and the famous dodo bird have all disappeared. Actually, they didn't exactly disappear. They were simply killed off. But of course, this is nature's way. Man merely hurries a process along whenever he can be of help. Man and birds have been responsible for a great many advances in our civilization. For example, the bird was the inspiration for the invention of gunpowder, and it was his speed that brought about the development of the shotgun. But man has not been unmindful of his debt to the bird. We have honored our feathered friends in many ways. We cage birds and show them off proudly in most of our zoos. And the turkey is traditionally our guest of honor at Thanksgiving. I suspect you never realize that if it weren't for birds, even some of our pastimes would suffer noticeably. Duck hunting, for example. Granted, bagging a fellow hunter can be diverting, but the supply is rather limited. I hope you don't mind if I have something to eat, but I'm rushed today. Planning the lecture has been most educational for me. I've begun to feel very close to the birds and have developed a real sympathy for our little... What was I saying? Oh yes, I've come to feel very close to the birds and have come to realize how they feel when... I don't think I'll eat just now. Hardly proper with all of you here. Surely the birds appreciate all we've done for them. Don't you? Beautiful cage, fresh water, no other birds to bother you, none of that blinding sunlight. Oh! Now why would he do that? Most peculiar. What on earth? They're coming! They're coming! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!"

That arm can't do anything you don't want it to. How do you know that? Where does evil live? Does it live in the soul? In the mind? Maybe it lives in the flesh.

lHpQ2S_F3u8,1344,Cape Fear (1962)," Hi, I'm Rob Lurie. This is Trailers from Hell. Let's take a look at the trailer for Cape Fear not, the one that was remade by Martin Scorsese, but the actual original one from 1962. I love this trailer. I can't imagine though what audiences were thinking when they sat in the theater of their other movie and this one came up because this has got to be one of the most sexualized trailers I think I've ever seen, even for a movie that would come out in, you know, 2010. For example, Robert Mithrim coming in, the chick is in bed lying there, he's obviously going to, you know, either rape her or grab her or, you know, who knows what, he's got his naked torso there, look at her face, she's running away. How could they put this trailer out in 1962? I don't know, but I absolutely approve. Gregory Peck was the producer of this movie. The original title I think was The Executioners, and Peck thought that was a terrible title for a movie, and he thought for reasons that I still don't understand that movies with the names of locations in them as titles, that is what would sell. And so he took his finger, went down the map of the east coast of the United States, and actually found a Cape Fear in North Carolina. The film in fact actually bombed, and it shut down Gregory Peck's production company, which I sort of understand seeing how he picks titles. Now, the role of the daughter there was originally going to be played by Hayley Mills, but there was a small problem, she was under contract at Disney, and as you can see from this trailer, they certainly were not going to allow her to do that, nor probably would her mom and dad. Again, you have to just look at the sexual energy in this trailer, and it in fact is much more dramatic than it actually existed in the film. Those of you who are familiar with Cape Fear probably are familiar with it from the remake that Martin Scorsese made. Gregory Peck's role was played by Nick Nolte, and Robert Mitchum's role was done by Robert De Niro, both of whom ended up having cameos in the film."

But I'll catch him and kill him. Did you hear your father? Out of the water now. This shark will swallow you whole. We're going to need a bigger boat. Got the 20 footer. 25. Three tons on him. Hurry up. He's coming straight for us. Don't screw it up now. Don't wait for me. Now! Shoot! Watch the tail. Give him room. I can't. He's trying to run. Oh! I can't quit. I can't hold it. Hurry!

The person who pulled the trigger and ended the life of Medgar Evers is this defendant, Byron D. LeBeckwith. Why'd I have to go digging on things that happened 25 years ago anyway? You persecute a 70-year-old man over some nigger, you'll have everybody in the state of Mississippi lined up against you. Evidence has been lost. In 1964, you had a mountain of evidence. Well, as you can see, the mountain has crumbled to dead. John Goza is dead. Herbert State is dead. Bill Pittman is dead. We have to make the past start living again. 25 years ago, I was on the witness stand and I watched as the former governor of this state shook hands with the man who murdered my husband. Are you admitting to me that you... Killed Medgar Evers? What if I did? It's not like there's anything you or anybody else can do about it. Yes, sir. My car's been vandalized, my son's been in a fight, and I've been called every ugly thing there is by every racist in the state of Mississippi. You think that this one trial's gonna magically change all of this? It's a step. Why do I have to take that step so that some sick lunatic can murder my wife and my children? Someday they're gonna be able to tell their children that it was their daddy who put away the man who killed Medgar Evers.

IuImwxk3xUk,1913,Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)," I'm not really a particularly nostalgic person, but I think films remain outside of nostalgia. I think they're like little worlds that you lived in, like a period you lived in another country. With a film and that little world, when you recall it, you remember the good and the bad in equal measure. So it's a very pure kind of memory. When I sat down with Picnic at Hanging Rock, I was somewhere in my early thirties, Patricia Lovell had bought a ground to me. I mean, I knew who she was. She was a television personality, but that was a very curious knock at my door. She'd seen an early film of mine. I think it was Homesdale. I can't say what connection she saw in it. I'm delighted she did to think that I could handle something like this. In that period in the Australian film industry, in the early seventies, the idea of making a film from a book was really very foreign. It sounded the big time. That's what they do overseas, whereas we wrote our own stuff. I read it from cover to cover, was gripped by it and by the fact it was an unsolved mystery. I was burning with it. It was just like electricity through my body. I was very keen to make it. I said, Pat, how do you go about this? Do you have to get rights? That's how early it was in the revived Australian industry. But the gatekeeper wasn't in this case a bank manager or a film distributor financier. It was Joan Lindsay herself. She had to approve the production team. It certainly had to approve the director, so I had to go and meet her. She was a woman of refinement, of elegance, a woman from a world as vanished as is the world of the characters in Hanging Rock. She was married to Sir Darrell Lindsay and that's where I met her at her wonderful farm out of Melbourne for a lunch. This lunch was pivotal. We went there, Pat Lovell and I, with her publisher and she was going to approve me or not. So it was strangely an audition and a director is not used to being auditioned. The conversation was abane and wide reaching about art and painting and the Lindsay family. Through the windows was this glorious farm. It was in some ways like being in a setting of the film itself. After lunch over coffee, I asked a question I'd been told not to ask and that question that I'd been prepped by the publisher, he said, don't ask Lady Lindsay whether the story is true or not. Now the book is introduced by a paragraph that says something like, whether this story is true or not, the characters involved are long since dead so it hardly seems to matter. So it was obscure and tantalising and implied that it was true. So I thought, whether I get the job or not, I must ask this question otherwise it's a bad start and I have to know. She has to tell me all her secrets. So I introduced the question over that coffee in that lovely room that I said, Lady Lindsay, I've been told not to ask you this but is the story true? And she said, young man, I hope that you do not ask me the question again. And I said, that's fine. Okay. And I said, well, I'll move to another difficult question and you may tell me that you're not going to answer this but I said, I mean, do you think it's wide open what happened to these girls? I mean, in your mind, do you think they fell down a hole? Do you think, for example, they were abducted by aliens? And she said, any of the above."

What do you mean don't touch me? You're supposed to be husband and wife. No really, I'm the luckiest girl. What did you say? One, two, three, get out of the car. I fell madly in love with him. I haven't won a championship since 1966 and I missed that game because that's the day I had Billy. Did you like Ruffalo too? If you fail, you can advance to court. Very evil and very bad things are gonna happen. Can you go to jail or something? Yeah, but he was innocent. Remember that guy No good. I'd really like to find him.

GcZ89Aj2zs0,1927,All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)," Hi, I'm Ed Neumeyer and welcome to Trailers from Hell. I want to talk about the greatest war movie ever made, All Quiet on the Western Front. It's a movie that a lot of people have heard of, but few people have seen. And I think one of the reasons why is the trailer I'm about to show you. This is a re-released trailer and it sort of pounds you over the head with what an important movie this is and how good it is for you, like it's homework or cod liver oil. But All Quiet on the Western Front is really a great piece of filmmaking and it establishes a template for many, many of the war movies that follow it. Eric Maria Remarque's devastating novel about World War I was an international publishing sensation in 1929. Universal put it into production immediately under the direction of Lewis Milestone with a big budget, a script by George Abbott, Maxwell Anderson and Del Andrews. The story begins as young Paul Baumer, played by Lou Ayers and his fellow schoolmates, are encouraged by their blowhard teacher to join the German army and go off to fight for the glory of the Fadland. Paul and his buddies head off to the army with great excitement. They train under a tough sergeant, but it's mostly a lot of fun, sort of like living in a frat house and they can't wait to get into battle. Of course they really don't know what they're in for and in All Quiet on the Western Front they're in for incompetent officers, hunger, boredom and desperation followed by the death and destruction of everyone they know and everything they care about. The film may be 80 years old, but it's good to remind yourself that it was made by young filmmakers at the height of their creative powers. Lewis Milestone was 34, he was a hot director who had already won an Academy Award for Best Direction and for All Quiet on the Western Front he's going to win another one. He was assisted by a brilliant young director just out of the Hollywood from Broadway named George Cukor who was barely 30. Steven Spielberg is on record saying that he watched All Quiet in preparation for Saving Private Ryan. Stanley Kubrick made two movies, Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket that contained All Quiet's DNA. When I was writing the script for Starship Troopers I found myself watching it late one night and I realized in a flash that the author of the novel, I was adapting Robert Heinlein, an admitted movie buff, had repurposed the entire structure and borrowed many of its characters for his jingoistic take on militarism and morality. Hollywood sometimes likes to make a version of the story in which the heroes actually experience the glory they have been promised by their blowhard mentors and where their deaths are moving, meaningful and entertaining. But not here. All Quiet on the Western Front is an anti-war movie that proudly wears its pacifist politics on its sleeve. The battle scenes you're watching right now are taken from an amazing seven minute sequence that comes at the movie's 40 minute mark. There is no music and no dialogue, just the relentless alien whine and screech of incoming shells. The camera moves along trenches like a belt through a machine gun. Explosions tear men to pieces, leaving their limbs to hang like laundry on the barbed wire. So check it out film fans. If you like war movies, it's one of the greats. If you want to make a war movie, you'll get some good ideas. And if you're in the actual war making business, it might make you think twice. Well, it probably won't, but it'll give you something to look forward to."

E2eAXa7rNXw,1940,Gentleman's Agreement (1947)," When Laura Z. Hobson's great story, Gentlemen's Agreement, first appeared serially in Cosmopolitan magazine, its 20 million readers were startled at its daring. As a book, Gentlemen's Agreement still leads all bestseller lists month after month. No story of the last decade has hit the literary world with such terrific impact. The author has deftly treated a taboo topic to give it excitement, exhilaration, and entertainment. And now, as a motion picture, Gentlemen's Agreement is accorded the highest honor a picture can be given. Here we see its producer, Darryl Efzanek, receiving the Academy Award for the best picture of the year. To do the screenplay, Mr. Efzanek engaged Moss Hart, who wrote Lady in the Dark, The Man Who Came to Dinner, and other great stage hits. For director, he chose Elia Kazan, whose talents now win the Academy Award for the best direction of the year. In selecting the cast, the roles were filled with unusual care. The part of Phil Green, the fighting author, was given to Gregory Peck. Face me now, Miss Wales, come on, look at me. Same face, same eyes, same nose, same suit, same everything. Here, take my hand, feel it. Same flesh as yours, isn't it? No different today than it was yesterday, Miss Wales. Dorothy McGuire was chosen to play the emotional but confused Cathy. I don't have to kiss you in public, I've got a nice dark taxi outside. Well, what are we waiting for? Come on, don't just stand there. To play Dave, Phil's understanding friend, the preference was John Garfield. I wonder if you'd feel so ill now, Cathy, if you hadn't nailed him. You know, there's a funny kind of elation about stocking back. I learned that a long time ago. Phil's learned it. The part of the forthright, hurt and frustrated Anne, went to Celeste Holm, who in this role wins the Academy Award as the best supporting actress of the year. Ann Arsene's Anne Revere as Phil's understanding mother. June Havoc as Miss Wales, Phil's secretary. Albert Decker as the sympathetic publisher. Jane Wyatt as Cathy's snobbish sister. Dean Stockwell as Tom, Phil's young son. Don't shout at me. I know what you're thinking about marrying me. I saw it on your face when I said that to Tom. And don't treat me to any more lessons of tolerance, I'm sick of it. I am not going to marry into hotheads shouting and nerves and you might as well know it."

_K7g0_lklLE,1947,West Side Story (1961)," West Side Story is truly a unique film, not in the most obvious senses necessarily, because it is that also, but because it broke so many rules. It's really almost an American-style operetta. That's right away breaking a rule. Number two, it didn't have beautiful costumes. In fact, the gang boys really looked kind of ratty. The colors were dense and interesting and exciting, and the combinations that Irene Sherriff found, purples with blacks and maroons and browns, were interesting, but that's certainly not the choice of any musical costumes I've ever seen in my life. Number three, it was a very, very serious film. It was indeed Romeo and Juliet set to music with a musical frame around it. There are scenes of violence. I mean, did you ever see a Fred Astaire movie like that? And please, this has nothing to do with Fred Astaire movies not being great, but this broke every single rule that I can think of with respect to movies and didn't have a major star. Natalie Wood was not a major star when this film came out. The star of this movie, and it gives me goosebumps to think of it because it's so rare, was the movie, was the property itself, the play. That was the star, and that's what makes all of this, when you think of West Side Story, such a phenomenal experience in the annals of film musicals. This is not like any other film that ever happened in musicals, ever. I don't care how daring and brilliant and wonderful they were, there's nothing like this. And I thought possibly at the time that maybe there would be copycat movies. Not one. They wouldn't know where to start."

pFRx2fVeQj4,1953,"French Connection, The (1971)"," I'm Dennis Lehane and this is Trailers from Hell. And the film trailer we're going to be looking at is for 1971's The French Connection, which stars Gene Hackman, Roy Scheider, Fernando Rey. It's directed by William Friedkin. And it's weird to say about a movie that won the best picture, best actor that won several Academy Awards, to call it underrated. But I do believe that The French Connection is still an underrated film. Here, we'll take a look at the trailer. Popeye, Popeye's here! Put your hands on your heads! Get off the bar and get on the wall! What's my name? Popeye Doyle. If he doesn't like you, he'll take you apart. And it's all perfectly legal, because Doyle fights dirty. You want to take a ride there, fat man? So when you say The French Connection, people remember, well, picking your feet in Poughkeepsie, of course. And then they remember the car shows. And they remember Gene Hackman's pretty ferocious performance. But the film itself, I think, gets kind of dismissed as just a really well-mounted cop film. When it's anything but, I think that The French Connection is as close as we have on film to Moby Dick. It is Popeye Doyle is Ahab. Frog Number One, played by Fernando Rey, is the whale. This is a film about obsession. This is a film about class rage. You're seeing it right now in this scene. This is a scene in which he makes the decision to track these guys. And the reason he does it is because they're living better than he is. Because they're flirting with the cigarette girl that he wanted to flirt with, because they're passing money all around. And he says, where's mine? I'm just a civil servant. I don't get it. And so the only way he can get revenge in a sort of a class rage way is to go after the big bad guy, which is Fernando Rey's character. One of the things you see is usually whenever they bust anybody in the film, whenever there's a sort of a successful moment in the film where they bust somebody or they take somebody down, it's always somebody just as sort of poor as they are. They can never ever get to the big guys. This is a film that's so obsessed with obsession that in the end we don't even know what happens in the final 20 seconds of the film. Because it doesn't matter. It's all about Popeye Doyle putting all his rage, transferring everything he feels about the lot he's been dealt with in life on this guy, and chasing him relentlessly for two hours. I first saw it on Channel 38 in Boston when I was a kid, and I didn't know what the hell to make of it. It was way over my head. But it stayed with me. I think like a lot of good movies, it stuck with me. I kept obsessing over the ending. I couldn't believe that that ending was allowed. You would never be able to shoot that ending now, not in a major Hollywood film. The first note would be, what happens in the end when it goes black? And not only could you pull it off in 71, it was a successful movie. That just blows my mind. Because nobody knows what happens in that room at the end. You just hear a gunshot. It goes black. You hear a gunshot. Credits. Credits. The other thing about this film that I think is, is listen to the sound. There's an amazing sense of it. The sound design in this film is incredible. It sounds like they literally just went out guerrilla style and shot on the streets, and whatever sound was found on the streets when they were shooting just ends up in the mood. I don't think that's exactly what did happen, but it sounds like it. French Connection."
3VUblDwa648,1954,Rocky (1976)," His name is Sylvester Stallone. He's the star of a new film called Rocky. He's been described as tough, handsome, talented, sexy, sensitive, dynamic, brilliant. He's been compared to Nicholson, De Niro, and Brando, but he is Rocky. He's the man who could be loved by only one woman, because somehow she gets beneath the pain. He's every nobody who ever needed somebody. Rocky, do you believe that America is the land of opportunity? Yeah. I'll break both your arms so they don't wipe me. He's every man who ever settled for something less. One on my bright neck. At least you have bright. I ain't had no bright. I ain't had enough. I'm gonna get that. I'm gonna get that. Terrific.

nJAot8IWIUc,1964,Klute (1971)," Hi, I'm Kat Shea and this is Trailers from Hell. We're looking at the trailer for the amazing character study called Clute. I think a lot of Alan Pakula's movies are actually character studies and the plot is secondary. So let's take a look. I actually haven't seen this movie since I was a kid at the drive-in and my memory is that my parents were watching the movie and they thought that me and my brothers were asleep in the back seat. We watched like the sound of music first or something like that and then Clute came on and they checked to see if we were sleeping and they thought we were all sleeping. But I of course was faking and had one eye open and was just completely mesmerized from the very first scene. Maybe it was Jane Fonda's haircut, I don't know, it was the shag, possibly. I used to give all my friends shags when I was in high school, which was a little later. I think she set the trend. But I gave my friends these horrible haircuts and left mine long. Anyway, I love Jane Fonda in this movie. She has so much power and confidence. She's totally in control in this characterization which was written by Andy Lewis and Dave Lewis. Jane Fonda's Brie Daniels was unlike any prostitute I had ever seen in a movie or on TV. Okay, maybe I was a kid and I hadn't seen that many hooker portrayals, but it was still incredible. There's a shot in the movie, a very famous shot, where she's having sex with some client and she looks at her watch and you just know that she's totally in control of her business. She's the girl in Jeopardy in this movie, but you never get the feeling that she's vulnerable and I love that. It seems like in movies in general, vulnerability in women is such a prized thing and she wasn't that at all and she's running away from this male stalker killer and the audience is really frightened of this guy and she's supposed to be frightened too, but you never get the feeling that she's a vulnerable woman in Jeopardy. It's also really interesting. I think that Donald Sutherland was this private investigator, you know, he's the masculine presence who was going to save her and he was the emotionally vulnerable one. He was kind of a provincial guy. He came to New York City to investigate. She's the jaded city girl. He's tender, she's hard, they have a romance and it's really powerful. The details, I think, of this movie made it very powerful. Sutherland buys a piece of fruit and he's gently feeling this apricot and it's a big moment for Scheider's silent acknowledgement that he's being used. And I think what these comments add up to is that Pakula really managed to feel his way into these actors' performances and he helped them to become transparent. Perhaps that's why the movie's so indelible even though the plot seems so secondary to the character study that that movie really is."

Serena had an incredible number of boyfriends, at least 20. Rick Von Slonaker and Serena spoke, still together. Well, one thing's for certain, she's lost her virginity by now. How can you say that? You're right. Maybe she wasn't a virgin. Is it true you're a barit? As a matter of fact, it is. That'll take that sort of thing seriously, then. Rick Von Slonaker is tall, rich, good-looking, stupid, dishonest, conceited, in short, highly attractive to women. I don't see how that can be bad. I shouldn't have to go into all this sort of detail. Well, could you go into a few sort of details? They're doomed. What are you talking about? Downward social mobility. They're bourgeois. Chachacha. Playing strip poker with an exhibitionist somehow takes the challenge away. And in life. I mean, for them men are either dates, potential dates, or date substitutes. I find that dehumanizing. They're all so very metropolitan. I guess you could say it's extremely vulgar. I like it a lot."

Ucj_dADJaE0,1968,"Breakfast Club, The (1985)"," May 1st, 1985, seminar with director, producer, screenwriter John Hughes. The Breakfast Club was cast while I was doing 16 Candles. I wanted Michael, I wanted Molly, and I wanted Ali Shidi. And Emilio came in to read for John Vendrick, but I was looking for a character whose motivation in life is to be like everybody else. And I was having a hard time finding someone who could play the looks right, without ever opening his mouth. And I had Emilio. Emilio was reading off-camera stuff for somebody and I was watching him, I wasn't watching the other person. He did a great job, I remember, and I said, would you want to play Andy? He agreed. And then Judd, I had a hard time with that one too, because I had to find someone who was a pretty reprehensible guy, who said some pretty cruel things and said them repeatedly for a long period of time, and really doesn't get regained until the very end. And I needed someone who could, you know, I sort of based him on a guy that I knew in high school who was just a horrible guy, but you just liked to hang around with him. It was like a privilege to hang around with him and get insulted. And you know, like you'd never leave your sister in the house with him alone or any money out, you know, unprotected, but you wanted to be around him. I didn't have much luck here. I went to New York, I'd heard about this guy that was doing something and making the grade. He was late, I was waiting around, and Michael was there. Michael was in Catholic school at the time and he had his blue pants and his shirt and his tie, and I was sitting there waiting for this guy. And the door, the office in MC, the door burst open, and Judd came in and his pants were all torn, and he had the same boots he wore in the movie on, and he was just amassing his bag and he threw his stuff down and he said, I've been up all night on a plane, and he just turned right to Michael and started doing Bender on him. He was bang, bang, slapping Michael, and was gone in ten minutes. He finished saying, got up and said, I'll see you later, I've got to catch a plane. I looked at Michael and I said, okay, I think that's the guy. Michael said, yeah, I think he's a nice guy."

RRgbHgJa4-I,1999,"Exorcist III, The (1990)"," Hi, this is Josh Olson. You're watching Trailers from Hell, and we're going to talk about one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. A movie that was very overlooked when it came out. Written and directed by William Peter Blatty and based on his book Legion, it is a direct sequel to The Exorcist. At some point during the production, the studio noticed there was no actual Exorcist in the film, so Blatty had to add a plot involving Nicole Williamson's character Father Morning. George C. Scott plays the Lee J. Cobb role from the original, and this movie picks up where the first one left off with no mention of the disastrously received Exorcist 2. This is William Peter Blatty's Exorcist 3. The movie stars George C. Scott and Ed Flanders. There's an amazing chemistry between the two men as two old friends, one a cop, one a priest. Their conversations about old movies, religion, ethics, and life feel like they come from a real friendship. It's old, it's comfortable, it's lived in. I could listen to them for hours. Seriously, it would rival my dinner with Andre. They're wonderful. Just that alone makes this film work. It also contains one of the scariest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. There's a sequence in the middle set in a hospital that will just scare the crap out of you the first time you see it. And it's all about geography and sound and editing. It's one of the most cinematic things you'll ever see in a horror film. The film also features the single greatest use of Fabio, and Blatty's script manages to be both hilariously funny and genuinely terrifying. This is truly an unsung masterpiece. Blatty only directed two movies, which he also wrote. The first, The Ninth Configuration, is also magnificent and well worth looking for. As far as I know, that movie has no trailer, which is why you've never seen anyone talk about it here."

ooB2LlMsc7o,2024,"Rapture, The (1991)"," This is Michael Tolkien, this is Trailers from Hell, and I'm here today to talk about my movie The Rapture, the first film I directed in 1991. It's been long enough since I made the movie. My daughter was born during the mix, and she's now out of the house and I've got an empty nest, so it's been a while. The film was controversial in its day and has found an audience, which I'm grateful for, and I'm happy to talk about it right now. When the movie came out, there were four basic reactions to it. There were people who said, I hate this movie because it says that religion is real. There were people who said, I hate this movie because it says religion is fake. People who said, I love this movie because it says religion is real. And there are people who said, I love this movie because it says religion is fake. I've been listening to a lot of Christian radio, and I was really interested in making a film about faith from within the logic of the faith faith without criticizing it and to go to something deeper into an maybe it's just an American kind of end days fantasies and it actually wasn't that difficult to get the movie made a lot easier than anything I've tried since we were lucky to get Mimi Rogers early committed to the film as soon as David Duchovny came into the reading with Mimi we knew that he was cast he had a tremendous power I think he'd made a couple of movies but I like to think that we found something in David that has continued Patrick Beauchaud who plays Vic he's a very spiritual soulful person and he's got a kind of smoothness which really delicious as this orgy master and and there's a connection between I think between the idea of the orgy and the way that Mimi hands off the headphone to the other information operator at the beginning of the film those are the people who substitute for each other without any introspection or really without any hesitation that there's no identity left and I think that that's really what happens to me at the beginning she has no identity of her own and it's the religious experience that returns it to herself some people found it incredibly offensive that it turns out that all this talk about the rapture and God coming back to judge the world is true which I took as a good sign that either the audience was really emotionally and intellectually engaged with the film if there was anything that I was trying to do and it was sort of a broad cinematic intellectually pretentious zone it was to marry Fassbinder with Spielberg"

plSdhHECZUo,2115,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)," Hi, I'm Ty West and this is Trailers from Hell and now I'm talking about Temple of Doom. So after just gushing about Raiders and having it be this movie that first excited me about cinema and made me obsessed with this like like legendary movie character, I had no idea there was a Temple of Doom movie. No one told me. And so my whole life was Indiana Jones this, Indiana Jones that, the toys, the posters, the everything. And there was this other movie out there that no one told me about. And I remember being at school one day and someone saying like, well, what about the second movie? And I was like, what do you mean the second movie? And they were like, there's another movie with like they're eating monkey brains. And it was like the world kind of went and stopped because it was like, what do you mean? Like this is all I think about how could there be another movie? So I don't know if my parents were hiding it from me or if they just didn't know about it either. But I couldn't get out of school fast enough to go to the video store and find the movie. And so I found it and I went home and watched it. And it's to this day, one of like my favorite movies of all time. And it's my favorite of the series. I mean, I think Raiders is probably technically a better movie. But I've never seen a movie like Temple of Doom. There's nothing else like it. And in many ways, it's also like one of the best or at least my favorite horror movies. And I know nobody thinks of it like a horror movie because there's like humor in it and there's adventure in it. And it's a sequel to another movie that's not really a horror movie. But to me, it's about this cult and there's giant vampire bats and there's eating monkey brains and there's spiked rooms closing on people with skulls and there's people getting their hearts ripped out and slavery of children. It's very much a horror movie. And it very much exemplifies what I love about horror movies is that there don't have to be these genre constraints and that it can be anything. And I just think that there's very few movies at all that have ever been made like Temple of Doom. And I just think it's an amazing experience. All right, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, the sequel, although it is a prequel. And maybe everyone knows that now. I didn't know that until much after seeing the movie. I always just thought it was the second one and he just was done with Karen Allen and moved on. But apparently, this movie takes place beforehand. You can see in this trailer that it's also really kind of the idea of this character in a serial environment and being on different adventures. This movie is really... Because Last Crusade sort of connects to Raiders of the Lost Ark, whereas this movie exists on its own. And that's what I find so exciting about it is that you take this character and he's the one through line and then you get these new adventures. And this adventure was just so dark and extreme. And as a kid, that was the kind of stuff I was interested in. And it really kind of connected to me in this like provocative way. It's also the movie that I think the PG-13 rating was developed for. Although this movie is PG, this was the one that someone went, we really got to come up with something between PG and R because we can't have people's hearts getting ripped out. So oddly enough, the only PG-13 movie in the series is Last Crusade. So this one got away with the PG and then I guess Last Crusade paid for it."

jMTBTfr2lVY,2121,Cujo (1983)," I'm Mick Garrison. This is Trailers from Hell. There have been a lot of Stephen King movies and television adaptations and a lot of them are really crappy and a lot of them are really good and there's not much middle ground. I'm here today to talk about one of the not too often discussed really good ones, Cujo. Cujo is a genuinely grueling movie. It's really suspenseful, really terrifying. It didn't get an easy launch. Originally it was going to be directed by the brilliant Hungarian director Peter Medak who made The Changeling, one of my favorite ghost stories, as well as the mind-bending The Ruling class with Peter O'Toole. But for whatever creative differences Medak left the project with his highly regarded director of photography, Tony Richardson, after just two days of shooting. The project then fell into the hands of Louis Teague who had done such a great job with Alligator which had been scripted by no less than John Sayles. Teague recruited another cameraman who was to become a force to reckon with, the Dutch cinematographer Jan de Bont, who shot films like Die Hard and Basic Instinct before becoming a director and making movies like Speed and Twister and Lara Croft Tomb Raider. This isn't a supernatural Stephen King thriller. It's very earthbound and really, really human. The film is pretty faithful to King's book except for one very crucial exception. When I read the book, there came a point where something happens which I won't give away, and I kept turning the pages waiting for it to turn out to be a dream or something. It's really devastating and those who've read the book will know exactly what I'm talking about. The movie makes that one very important change and I have to admit, I was relieved. It would have made the film's grief unbearable. But when Dee Wallace and her son, played by a very talented young actor named Danny Pintoro, are trapped in their car with a huge rabid St. Bernard keeping them at bay, their suffering is almost impossible to watch. Made in 1983, this followed Dee Wallace's performance in both Joe Dante's The Howling and Steven Spielberg's E.T. and might be her most powerful role ever."

3sN-crgRXV0,2138,Watership Down (1978)," I saw Watership Down at the right age, right at the moment when I was, I was about 13, 14, and I was leaving behind my childhood and entering my teen years. And the movie was sort of a rite of passage because I saw a level of realism and drama and violence in animation. There's no need to take you back. Come on and try, you crack-brained slave driver. And it was such a watershed moment that I then decided to read the book. I came to the book after the film and I then read Plague Dogs and read Girl in a Swing and I really became quite enamored of his prose. But the film was the moment in which a kid my age came to realize animation was not just a medium for children's stories but it could be something else. It is a very old tradition to utilize animals to address social issues. You can do it through engravings like Granville, or you can do it through animal metaphors that are very heavy like animal farm or, you know, mouse later in a comic book form. But what was really powerful for me with What a Ship Down is that it was not trying to just mirror sociopolitical concerns. It was creating a world with sociopolitical concerns. When I say adult concerns, the novel and the film address a variety of things from making peace with mortality all the way to ecological concerns, the overgrowth of urban spaces and the destruction of natural spaces, bravery, the idea of community, the idea of oppression. These things that you find in adult discourse and in adult novels outside the realm of discussion for children were all in the film for me."

gHpCbrRcBhk,2206,Suspicion (1941)," There was something strange about Johnny Asgard. I knew it long before I married him. I knew you could put your finger on him. And yet you were always conscious of it. Conscious of something vague, restless, frightening. There was our first meeting on the hilltop. Now what did you think I would do, kill you? I think that's a murder can justify such a violent self-defense. It's so easy to think. I knew Johnny loved me as desperately as I loved him. And yet I remember now that even his reassurances seemed almost sinister. I want nothing but to spend the rest of my life with you. And if you were to die first, I... If I were to die first. From that moment on, my life was filled with fear. Thought of Johnny, I loved him too much to really be afraid. But the fear of not knowing, the agony of waiting, of wondering how it would happen, of waking in the middle of the night, shaking with terror and finding myself praying for him, that whatever it was, it would be done quickly and with mercy. These are the facts, the evidence before the crime. I wanted you to know in case I met a violent end. The End"

vGOaQLVZIlY,2212,"Man Who Knew Too Much, The (1934)"," Typically, the best source to use when restoring a film is the original negative. But in the case of Alfred Hitchcock's 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, the original negative had gone missing. So in 2002, while looking for the next best option, Criterion found a 35mm nitrate print once owned by legendary studio producer David O. Selznick, which you're seeing here. However, Selznick's print was so loaded with scratches and looked extremely grainy that we set the print aside in the hopes of finding the most original film element possible. Nearly 10 years later, we found what we were looking for. In 2011, we learned that the British Film Institute had in their vaults a 35mm nitrate fine-grain positive, a high-quality film element that is one generation away from the negative that went through the camera shot by Hitchcock and his crew. As with many nitrate films, working with this particular element posed some major challenges, including finding a scanner system that could handle its fragile nature. From the start, we intended to use a pin-registered scanning system. As the film moves through the scanner, small metal pins register through the film's sprocket holes, ideally holding the film in place, similar to what a projector does. Right away, we could see that the picture was a knockout, but the scanner could not handle the film. This was due to badly warped edging of the film, which we learned is a result of excessive anti-scratch treatments applied over time to the film stock. With every film pass, the acetone used in the process reduces film thickness by approximately 1 thousandth of an inch, hence the warping, which is unfortunately permanent. Also, with the warped edges, there was concern about whether or not the film had shrunk, because if it had, the pins could tear the sprocket holes and rip the film. So we brought in a shrinkage expert, and sure enough, the film had shrunk too much for us to use pin registration. The scanning process came to a halt until we could find a pinless, sprocketless scanner, one that can actually move the film across the scanner without concern for exact registration, preventing any chance of tearing the film. If the image is unstable, we knew we could stabilize it using various software once converted to a digital format. So we waited for almost a year, and it was well worth the wait. In 2011, the BFI were up and running with their new ARRI scanning system, with various options that allowed us to scan this aged film in different ways. Using their pinless, sprocketless setup, the first test we did was a direct scan from the fine-grey nitrate, and we were extremely happy with the results. The images looked great. In addition to this, the BFI thought it would be a good idea to print a wetgate dupe negative on a small section to see how it could improve the warping or any scratches or abnormalities that were left on the film, such as dirt or mold. This wetgate system is the most commonly used when printing film, and can be used in the scanning process as well. Running the film through a gate immersed in water, the original nitrate fine grain, which is a positive film element, is duplicated onto another piece of film, creating a negative image. A benefit to the wetgate is that in the duplication process, many scratches and dirt are removed. Seeing them side by side, as shown here, we felt that the direct scan of the original nitrate fine grain was the best route to take. When scanned dry, it proved that there were very few scratches to begin with, and any removal of dirt and scratches could be completed later using various restoration processes. In addition, we always prefer the idea of presenting a new restoration that began only one generation away from the original counter-negatives, for better resolution. So here we have the first generation raw scans in 2K resolution image, which have not been graded or restored. As you can see, there is far less damage here than in the Selznick print, but still a good amount of dirt and minor scratches, and the image jumps around within the frame. We employed various restoration techniques to remove nearly all the scratches and dirt, stabilize the image, and return the film to an image quality inherent in the original nitrate fine grain when it was originally made."

They are the legends we've all heard. Gang members drive around at night with their headlights off. And when someone goes to flash from their hyvens to warn them, they kill them. The stories we've all told. A guy and a girl, and they're parked out in the woods. The guy steps out, and the girl starts to hear these scratching noises. It's her dead boyfriend hung from a tree. The tales we've all listened to. Isn't there another story about a guy with an axe hiding in a woman's backseat? My mom still checks the backseat before getting into a car. But just because it never happened doesn't mean it never will. The decapitated body was found in her car. I knew I should have gone to NYU. This girl, she could have been any one of us. What if there is a lunatic on campus? What is he gonna do next, huh? Maybe put spider eggs in bubble gum? The idea of an urban legend serial killer. It's a stretch. The call's coming from inside the house. Could it be an urban legend? Something I can help you with. No, no, no, no, no, hey! I wanna know what's going on here. Someone out there is taking all these urban legends and making them reality. Urban legend. Have you heard the one about the microwave?"

ijwKT-pZ2yk,2281,Monument Ave. (1998)," I didn't tell you the story about the time Mouse broke into Yuppie's apartment. Same as you hear this story? This is a great fucking story. This is fucking hilarious. There was a place up in Monument Avenue that Mouse and I were looking at for a long time to break into. It was going to be the two of us together, but I was someplace. Where the fuck was that? I don't know where it was. Anyways. So Mouse decides to break in on his own, which Mouse, like I do, is a fucking wicked bad idea. Like a time down in North End, you ate a whole fucking hot pepper in one bite. I thought that was a pickle. This is worse than that. So anyways. I'm not just fucking the story. You tell the story, I'm going to tell the one about that bra. It was going down on you and you puked. Who, Connie Feelin'? Fuck, I'm proud of that story. You gotta tell it. This is when she was skinny. It wasn't like I took her to the fucking prom. She blew me and she puked. Big deal. Anyways, he breaks in by himself. So he's in this apartment. Beautiful fucking place, right? And he's looking at the place and he's admiring the books and saying hello to the cat, the whole thing. And now he figures it out all the time, because the guy works nine to five. It's like one o'clock in the afternoon. First thing he does, he makes a sandwich. That's what you always do when you're breaking out a place. What was the sandwich? Ham and three cheese. Right, three cheeses. Yeah, with tomato sauce. It was a Havati. Havati and blue cheese. And a Gallup and Gourmet over here. Anyways, he starts eating the sandwiches halfway through the sandwich and now he's going to take a shit. So he goes out of the stairs, he's sitting on the throne, reading some magazine. What was it, Time or Newsweek? Yeah, no. Coming events? Yeah. Good magazine. Anyways, so he gets done. He goes upstairs, he finds a waterbed, which he's never seen before. He's only seen on TV, like in commercials and stuff where he's heard about it. So here he is getting ready to get on the waterbed and he finds right next to the waterbed. What has he always wanted to find his whole life he can never find? Baseball. He's been wanting a lot of fucking money, guys. Big photo album full of fucking old baseball cards, right? So here he is on the bed, he's jumping up and down, he's creaming in his pants, flipping through the baseball cards, fucking Mickey Mouse rookie card, Tom Severs rookie card, right? He's so goddamn happy, feels he's going to be rich, he's got it made, he falls asleep. I took a move before I broke in, I was out of the shit. That's what I do before I pull a job down, you know? So anyways, four hours later he wakes up to the sound of the key in the door, fucking Goldilocks here. I wake up and I think I'm at my mother's house, but this guy is staring at me, guy in a suit. Big fucking guy. And he says to me, excuse me, and I'm like, who the fuck are you? And he picks up the phone, starts to call the cops and I'm like, shit, I realized where I am, so I bolt. I'm out the door, I dodge around that guy, bit of a dance. Leave him everything behind, by the way, the baseball cards, the TV, everything. Doesn't take anything. So here you have this guy who owns the apartment on the line with the cops, going, yeah, somebody just broke into my apartment. The cops are going, what did he take? He looks around, fucking that.

iGgug8_Tn1M,2403,First Blood (Rambo: First Blood) (1982)," Hi, this is Alan Spencer for Trailers from Hell. Did you know the name Rambo comes from an apple? When something enters the pop culture pantheon, often the original meaning gets lost. The name Rambo is now part of right-wing jinglingism. But if you look at the original movie that began the cinematic odyssey of John Rambo, as well as the excellent novel that it's based upon, written by David Morrell, you're gonna find a different story. And that story is called First Blood. Sylvester Stallone is John Rambo, an ex-Green Beret, who comes to visit an old army buddy, then finds out he died from Agent Orange. Stallone is very effective in these early scenes, supported by Jerry Goldsmith's doleful score. Heading into town, he runs afoul of a sheriff played by Brian Dennehy. This character's been called a redneck, but he's more of a bipartisan asshole. He's arrogant and xenophobic and regards Rambo as a vagrant and a troublemaker. He's also about to experience an after-school special of pain. The police department in this is like a psychotic version of Supercuts. The cops are obsessed with good grooming and are determined to give Stallone a shower and haircut by force. And no, that's not Carrot Top, but a young David Caruso playing one of the abusive officers. Anyway, when they try to give Rambo a shave, all hell breaks loose. They really should have used an electric razor, because Stallone has a Vietnam flashback that triggers his combat mode, and he declares full-scale war on law enforcement. What ensues is a gripping action adventure that's evocative of everything from High Sierra, Deliverance, Lonely or the Brave, and even the most dangerous game. Stallone is hunted like a wild animal, and we're on his side because he's an innocent victim that keeps declaring, I didn't do anything. The analogies about the way Vietnam War vets have been mistreated when they've come home is no coincidence. The film is grim and violent, so it's hard to believe they ever made a Saturday morning cartoon about Rambo. That's like making an animated series about Charles Bronson's character from Death Wish. Even harder to believe is Richard Krena wasn't the first choice to play Colonel Troutman. Kirk Douglas was, but he tried to rewrite the movie to make it all about him. It's an honest mistake. I'm sure all those extras that shouted, I am Spartacus, told their friends and family they played the title role. First Blood is about war, and like any war, there were casualties. In the original version, Rambo commits suicide. Test audiences didn't like that, so Rambo lived to fight another day. Besides, he was so tough that shooting himself in the head would just be a flesh wound. Directed by Ted Kotcheff, First Blood is a classic action adventure and showed the world Sylvester Stallone knew how to fight outside a boxing ring. Are you telling me that 200 men against your boy is a no-win situation for us? If you send that money, don't forget one thing. A good supply of body bags."

cd59DT2nPWQ,2488,Peeping Tom (1960)," I'm Allison Anders. This is Trailers from Hell. And this trailer is for Peeping Tom, an amazing Michael Powell movie, which pretty much ended his career. This trailer really sets this film up as a thriller, and I guess that's what people thought that they were getting when they came to see this very odd, very dark movie of Michael Powell's, and also pretty brilliant movie. When I first saw this film, I was a young mother who would stay up late at night, having my little time to myself in the wee hours, and this was on TV often. And I know that the first time I saw it, I couldn't quite believe it. This was right when I was doing all my prerequisites for film school. ...as the Peeping Tom. Fear him, but pity him also. Morris Shearer here was in two previous, very successful Michael Powell productions. She was a ballet dancer. At this point, she was already Lady Kennedy. She had been his heroine in The Red Shoes, which was very successful, very, very expensive production, and also she was in Tales of Hoffman. In this film, she's playing a very different character, a very saucy kind of dancer that sadly meets her demise. Apparently the film was so horribly received because people just were not prepared to be put in the position of empathizing for this psycho killer. They buried the movie, actually tried to get rid of all the prints. The strange film takes you into a very voyeuristic position, not only as film as voyeurism with our killer being a filmmaker of sorts. He's not much of a filmmaker, but he does shoot a lot of film. He's also a pornographic photographer. We see him commit the crimes, but we also come to have empathy for him because as you start to see throughout the film, he was really terrorized by a camera as a child for his father's research, and then he becomes a filmmaker himself. When you see the footage of the killer as a young boy with his father, the father is played by Michael Powell himself."

Q4uLo1LQ6PA,2499,God Said 'Ha!' (1998)," My next movie is a very special one named God Said Ha. It's a funny and touching one-woman performance piece by Julia Sweeney, but you might remember from Saturday Night Live where among other characters she played the curiously androgynous person named Pat. In the film she describes her life in the weeks and months after her brother learned that he had cancer, and both her brother and her parents moved into her new home where she was just beginning to enjoy some privacy for the first time in her entire life. For example, this is how my mother would answer the phone. Hello, this is Jerry Sweeney answering the telephone to take down a message for her daughter. Julia, sweetie. I had to take her aside and say, you know, hello. The underlying subject matter is cancer, and that's serious, but Sweeney brings the saving grace of humor to her account of everyday life. Her mother emerges as a lovable but maddening woman who, like the mother and blast from the past, might also have spent a year since 1962 in a bomb shelter. And my mother immediately came back and she said, Julie, I'm sorry to bother you, but I have been through your kitchen top to bottom and I cannot find where you keep your mixes. And I said, my what? And she said, your mixes, you know, like your Laura Scudder's beef stroganoff mix. Where is that? God Said Ha is the kind of movie I was hoping for when I went to see Patch Adams, the Robin Williams film. Now, there's been a big national discussion about the fact that the public liked Patch Adams, and there wasn't a critic of any stature in the country who liked it. Why did the critics hate it? I think because we're looking for a movie like God Said Ha, which also is humorous and also has personal observation and is also about dying and about death, but has taste and intelligence. Instead of just pounding the audience over the head with the most obvious and manipulative gimmicks in order to get them to cry. You cry during this film, but you cry because you empathize with this person. So thumbs up for God Said Ha. It's a wonderfully funny observant, life-affirming film."

F1wVvWL0pJU,2519,House on Haunted Hill (1959)," Hi, I'm Mick Garris and welcome to Trailers from Hell. Today's hellish trailer is for a film from 1959 by William Castle, The House on Haunted Hill, one of the formative films of my childhood. House on Haunted Hill, the exterior of that house is the Ennis Brown House in the Hollywood Hills. It was one of a handful of homes designed in Los Angeles, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It's in a state of disrepair these days, but it was used in Blade Runner as well as this. One of the Frank Lloyd Wright houses in LA was bought and restored by Joel Silver, who ended up producing the remake of House on Haunted Hill 40 years later with Bill Malone directing it. So a little piece of trivia there. Julie Mitchum, who played the character of Ruth, was Robert Mitchum's sister. She only made I think four or five movies, but this was probably the only famous one she was ever in. Personally, this film has a real attachment to me because I had written an amazing stories episode called Go to the Head of the Class that Bob Zemeckis had directed. It was written as a half hour and Zemeckis shot a lot of extra film and they turned it into a one hour episode. And so the opening title sequence is over a scene from House on Haunted Hill that goes on and on and on and it's really dull and they released it as part of a theatrical feature overseas and they cut most of that House on Haunted Hill footage, fortunately. This was the first of two movies that Vincent Price made with William Castle. And Castle was kind of the PT Barnum of the movie world. He did not trust that an audience would go to his movies unless they were compelled by reasons other than just the film itself. So there was always a gimmick. A movie called Macabre, he came up with the idea of a million dollar Lloyd's of London policy if you were to die of fright in the theater. In The Tingler, there were little vibrating machines under about a third of the seats in the movie theaters where it played that every time The Tingler would show up, it would go brrrr and you'd get a little shock, a little jolt. In House on Haunted Hill, the brilliant system of emergo consisted of a fake skeleton on a wire that would jump out and go out over the heads of the audience in the theater at selected points. So really a great process. Cinerama had nothing on emergo. Music"
PACKbKt8MOw,2520,Airport (1970)," Airport, the year's most widely read novel, becomes today's most exciting, most timely motion picture. Airport, big scale in every way, has the biggest all-star cast ever assembled for a single universal motion picture. Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, Gene Seabert, Jacqueline Bisson, George Kennedy, Helen Hayes, Van Heflin, Maureen Stapleton, Barry Nelson, Lloyd Nolan, Donna Winter. The pilot from Your Flight 45 made a shortcut across the field and he didn't make it. But what are you doing about it? Well, when the snow melts in April, we'll get it out. What the hell do you think I'm doing about it? Outselling any novel of recent years, translated into 14 languages, Arthur Haley's Airport was written for the screen and directed by Academy Award winner George Seaton. It has seven stories tied into one. Dean Martin is pilot Bernard Dummerist, loved by stewardess Jacqueline Bisson and by his wife Barbara Hale. You're sure? Do you mean am I sure I'm pregnant or am I sure you're the father? Burt Lancaster is airport manager Mel Bakersfield at the crisis stage with his socialite wife Donna Winter. A week ago I didn't know we'd have the worst storm in six years. You've always got some damn excuse. Gene Seberg is Tanya, his devoted assistant. I'll miss you. Will you? Enough not to let me go. The first lady of the American stage, Helen Hayes, plays the mind-boggling, huggable, perpetual stowaway Ada Quonset. Oh my dear, I couldn't possibly afford a ticket. Van Heflin gives a superb performance as the desperate Guerrero, matched by Maureen Stapleton as his wife. Stop dreaming. Just hold on to the job. I'll do it right this time. I won't mess it up. And lusty gutsy Petroni has to be Academy Award winner George Kennedy. I'll have this mother out of here by midnight. Is there any chance that the plane would stand the explosion? Oh she might still fly. But the sudden decompression at 30,000 feet is something you gotta see to believe. Now sit down and be quiet. You hurt me. You hurt me. Stop it, you're hysterical. Please help me. Help me. Help me. No. No. No. Personal property, you've got no right to take it away from me. Stop it. No. No. No. You stay where you are. Guerrero, listen to me. You'll kill yourself for nothing if you explode that bomb. For crisis authenticity, airport has no equal. For mounting tension, airport has no equal. Decompression making emergency descent. For sheer fingernail biting suspense, airport has no equal. You are leaving my area. Contact Cleveland Center 117.5. Good luck. We're gonna crash. We're gonna be killed. I know we're all gonna be."

znZx1T5d68Q,2527,Westworld (1973)," Hi, welcome to Trailers from Hell. I'm Ed Neumeyer and I'm here to talk about a movie that influenced me a good deal called Westworld, which I saw when it came out in 1973. It was directed by Michael Crichton. It was sort of the first time I ever saw a movie about robots and how they saw the world and what might happen. And I think later on that came back to haunt me when I wrote RoboCop. MGM presents Westworld. I remember this first shot very well because it was like mirrored sunglasses and this seemed very, very like, oh my goodness, I could not imagine what kind of a science fiction movie I was going to see here when I saw these shots. It's pretty spare now, but they get away with it pretty well. I think it reminds me a little bit of science fiction post-Cubric in the way it's played. Most of what we're learning here is about how this theme park that they're going to visit works. Obviously this is a dry run or a test run for Jurassic Park many years later. What I found when I watched it again was that it's really all about sort of a place where adults can go to either shoot people or have sex. There's a shot of Yul Brynner there where they're taking his face mask off. This is what I mean by being kind of influential because I can't imagine that Jim Cameron did not see this movie before he made Determiner. Not only do you have this kind of robot android creature chasing you around, but he's rather relentless. And the whole movie kind of goes to that. Here we have our protagonist played by Richard Benjamin, who's sort of the everyman nebbish, and his pal who knows everything, James Brawlin. And he's really doing kind of Eastwood here or maybe even Christian Bale. Just give him whiskey. He's new in town. Many elements of the Delos Resort are potentially dangerous. That's part of the appeal. Go on. You say something, boy. Kill him. You're moving. Yul Brynner is reprising a role that he was known for in the Magnificent Seven, the gunfighter named Chris. Here it's known, the wardrobe is somewhat consistent, but here he is playing just a character known as the Gunslinger. And so after, you know, sort of the little death and sex, things go wrong. You know they're going to. This is an interesting movie because it's sort of the first time you had the idea of a computer virus affecting things and having things go very wrong. And for me, one of the things that I was very intrigued by was the first movie that had some real digital imagery in it. The point of view of Yul Brynner, the android, is shown here. And I think it's the first time I ever remember seeing anything like that. Later on Cameron has a version of that in The Terminator. And when we were doing Robocop, we talked a lot about how the android would see things. Shut down. Shut down immediately. I guess this movie couldn't have been made if there wasn't such a place as Disneyland, a very Southern California and sort of movie-oriented experience in its inception. And this is probably where the baby boomer imagination takes Disneyland, which is sort of that if we go to Disneyland and we have a lot of fun, and we indulge in our fantasies, ultimately somewhere we're going to pay the price for it. I presume if they remake this movie, which they talk about from time to time, you could probably set it as a reality show set in Las Vegas. Boy, do we have a vacation for you."
KijpaMtf41U,2528,Logan's Run (1976)," We asked Jenny Agater, the star of Logan's Run, to describe for us life in the 23rd century as envisioned in the film Logan's Run. The society is geared towards pleasure so that everybody is happy and content, right? There is anything that you want in the way of entertainment. You can go and have a new face, a new body, a complete change. Which is all done by laser surgery. So you can look any way you want. You can do anything you want. There are drugs and hallucinogenics and all of those things. It's so far removed. How do they travel? In cars? In the maze cars. They are very fast glass bubbles and they travel through these tunnels at great speed from one quadrant of the city, one part of the city to the next. What were the frightening things apart from the fact of course that life had no meaning and that... And the death at 30 and everything. Yes. The only dangerous part of the city is where some of the younger members live and they are called the cubs and they go through an age where they are really rowdy and they are still yellow. They have the yellow crystal in their hands. And people are warned not to go to the cathedral, which is a part of the city, where these youngsters, the cubs, tear around and they just cause a great deal of fuss. I mean it's rather like hooligans. They really are hooligans of that society. But outside of that, everything is smoothly run and pleasurable and there is no cold. The temperature is 72 degrees all year round. There are no difficulties as such. But the trouble is, as you say, there are no responsibilities. There is no real caring about anything. There is no involvement in anything. There is no dedication to anything. And all of those to me are horrors. I mean it really would be strange. It might be... It means that the people can continue, but it's not a real continuation because there is no growth there."

4yFJVqrln44,2551,Dead Ringers (1988)," Hi, I'm Mick Garris and this is Trailers from Hell. You know, I've always been a huge fan of the work of David Cronenberg, ever since I first saw Rabbit at the World Theatre in Hollywood. I was so impressed by his really unique writing and filmmaking style that the very next day I went to see it on a double bill with They Came from Within, also known as Shivers. So I've loved his work ever since then, but it was 1988 that brought about what I think is his masterpiece, and that's the film Dead Ringers. This movie was originally titled Twins, but Universal Pictures paid a lot of money to the producers of Dead Ringers so that they could use that title for the Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito comedy that year. This is the story of Elliot and Beverly Mantle, twin gynecologists and their slow mental decline into insanity. The role of the twins was reportedly declined by both Robert De Niro and William Hurt, but thank goodness, Jeremy Irons plays the twins with astonishing complexity and reality from the inside out. Just one of these performances would have been award worthy, but Irons has an amazing capacity to play the little differences between the brothers with incredible subtlety and richness, truly a bravura turn. One of my favorite acting performances of all time. Well, two of them rather. The script was written by Cronenberg and Norman Snyder and is unflinching and bold in its representation of sexuality and the baser instincts of man taking over his civilized side. In a way, it's a Jekyll and Hyde tale, though it seems to turn into a hide and hide story near the end. Their sanity slips away so subtly and believably that you can actually feel a sense of despair of your own as they whirl away into an abyss of drug addiction, sexual experimentation, and the creation of truly horrific, yet beautiful, insectile surgical instruments to operate on, as they put it, mutant women. Cronenberg also makes incredible use of his constant composer Howard Shore, who used to lead the original Saturday Night Live band, and cinematographer Peter Sushitzky. It's an amazing movie and I haven't seen anything like it since. Separation can be a terrifying thing."

YqlozoXVxYM,2553,Village of the Damned (1960)," Science fiction has never imagined so strange or terrifying a story as that of the village of Midwich, England, cut off from life as we know it by some mysterious force.

Forces put to such sinister use that it became a national emergency. We are gathered here as advisors, as scientists, as government experts.

There's Paul from England, Nina from Russia, Rashid from India, Mi Ling from China, Agal from Nigeria and Mark from America. Who are they really?

The ambassadors of all the earth's nations experience their defiance. We must know how to make that machine. We'd never think of trying to force you, of course.

1oKbpRgkJrM,2637,"Mummy's Hand, The (1940)"," Hi, I'm Joe Dante. This is Trailers from Hell. Most of us monster kids used to, you know, we loved Frankenstein, we loved Dracula, we loved Wolfman, but the mummy often was a little bit of a sticking point because us kids used to say to each other, well, you know, I mean, he just moves really slow, you know? I mean, he's always limping and anybody could run away from the mummy. But the interesting thing was, nobody ever did. He always got his victim. So I guess the appeal of that allowed them to make succeeding mummy movies. And this is the second of the universal mummy movies, the beginning of a start of a new franchise, The Mummy's Hand. Unlike Frankenstein and Dracula, The Mummy produced no sequels during the 1930s. But eight years after its release, Universal went back to the tomb for what we would now call a reimagining, combining its mummy wrappings with the kind of grade B action programmers that the studio specialized in. The result was The Mummy's Hand starring a new mummy, Charis, who, unlike the Karloff original, spends the whole movie lumbering around in bandages. And he comes with his own lore, kept alive by a brew made from Tana leaves. Under no circumstances must he be fed more than nine. He is loosed by vengeful high priest George Zucko on the infidel explorer heroes who defile the ancient dead of Egypt. Plenty of flashbacks from the original movie fill out the backstory. Charis was buried alive for trying to use Tana leaves to resurrect his dead lover, Princess Ananka. And Karloff is occasionally plainly visible, although new close-ups are of cowboy star Tom Tyler, who is the new mummy. If you were to kill me, you're leaving at large a monster that only I can control. It's actually a lot of fun and looks more expensive than it is thanks to a fabulous leftover set from James Whale's Green Hell. The cast is game and prolific director Christie Cabani keeps it all moving swiftly enough to engage the kid audience it was aimed at. Three even more economical mummy movies followed, all set in the United States, as portrayed by the versatile Universal Backlap, and featuring Lon Chaney beneath the wrappings."

E5qbo4sqUNw,2646,House of Dracula (1945)," Hi, I'm Joe Dante. This is Trailers from Hell. Today we're going to see a trailer for one of the last in the line of the Universal Classic horror pictures, the Frankenstein series slash Wolfman Dracula series when they started to mush all the monsters together. This is the sequel to House of Frankenstein called House of Dracula. They couldn't think of another thing to call it, so it's just another house movie. And it's, I think, a lot of fun, but you may differ. Your mileage may vary. Here it is. One monster would be terrific, but here are five! Five monsters, even though one of them's a girl. The success of Frankenstein meets the Wolfman paved the way for the multi-monster rally House of Frankenstein, whose box office success led to this final chapter and virtual remake, the seventh Frankenstein and the fourth Dracula and Wolfman picture. Times were changing, and this was pretty much the end of the line for the classic Universal horror pics. After this was released in 1945, most of the contract players were let go, and the studio gave up on horrors for a while. Kept alive by the blood of innocent people. When the full moon rises, I turn into a werewolf. Dracula and the Wolfman show up at the door of Dr. Edelman looking for cures to their ailments, but only Chaney gets cured. And even that cure doesn't take, because a few years later he sadly reverts back to werewolfry to appear in Avogastel and meet Frankenstein. This last of the series is cheaply produced, but still looks good. Carroting is still the highlight, as he was in the earlier film, as a most effective and hypnotic Dracula. He lobbied to recreate the look of Bram Stoker's character, but couldn't get much further than the clipped mustache with the Universal guys. Poor Glenn Strange fulfills Karloff's dire prediction that the monster would become a prop in the third act. But to us kids on Shock Theater, this was just as cool as the rest of the series. Thanks for watching!"

Ie1iJpS5qn4,2664,Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)," I hated to drag you out of bed at this time of night. Will you let me go while there's still time? You'll soon see why I did. Stop! Will you tell these fools I'm not crazy? Make them listen to me before it's too late! I'll listen to you. People are strange, and it's when they seem perfectly normal that you know things are getting really weird. That's what the hero discovers in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a 1956 B-movie horror science fiction classic directed by Don Siegel. Now even if you've never seen this movie, you may be aware of the legend of the pod people, alien beings intent on replacing the entire human race with perfect soulless replicas. Nice having backy back again, eh boy? These replicas, which grow in giant seed pods, look and behave exactly like we do, which is what makes them so terrifying. Now Invasion of the Body Snatchers is frequently interpreted as a Cold War allegory, with the pod people representing either the threat of communism or the deadening conformity of Eisenhower-era American society. Now you can certainly interpret the movie this way, but I don't think it would have lasted so long or been remade so many times if it didn't also tap into something much deeper. I don't want a world without love or grief or beauty. I'd rather die. The pod people's world has been wiped clean of the messiness of human psychology. There's no conflict, no ambition, no love, and therefore no sexual desire. The two main characters, Dr. Miles Bannell and Becky Driscoll, are old flames who reunite and clearly want nothing more than to jump into bed with each other. And it sometimes seems as if the whole alien conspiracy is designed to prevent exactly that from happening. Because instead of doing what they so obviously want to do, Miles and Becky have to run all over the little town of Santa Mira, California, trying to raise the alarm and get help. But virtually every figure of authority in the town, policemen, parents, doctors, turn out to be part of the pod people plot. This is the film's primal terror. Those who are supposed to be protecting us are imposters. Suddenly while you're asleep, they'll absorb your minds, your memories, and you're reborn into an untroubled world. Where everyone's the same? Exactly. Keep in mind though that this is a movie from the 1950s, which means that in the end, our trust in authority must be reaffirmed. So the studio bosses, in this case, imposed a more hopeful ending on invasion of the Body Snatchers than what Siegel had originally intended. Get on your radio and sound it all points along. In the end, everything's going to be fine. There's nothing to worry about. That's what this movie is telling us. And that's exactly what the pod people want us to do. Yes, it's an emergency!"

Marshall has told in blunt and blistering language the whole truth about the battle of Pork Chop Hill on the map only 237 feet high. On the screen, it towers above every war story ever told. Meanwhile, only 70 miles away, at Panmunjom, the peace talks dragged on. If we can settle on the truce line to which I thought you had agreed, this hill is right in the middle of the neutral zone.

Do you have any suggestions as to where these people can go? I'd better not. I'd hate to live through this just to be court-martialed. Look, I have about 25 men. They're completely spent. I expect a heavy attack about dark. That'll be half an hour from now. Unless we can be reinforced, we should be withdrawn over. Lieutenant, we can't reinforce and we have no authority to withdraw you. Out. The famous American war correspondent, Richard Tragaskis, has this to say about our picture.

qq45uHvNvD0,2697,My Son the Fanatic (1997)," Please sir, would a pose be alright? For private use, exclusively. Ready? Smile! When it was first released more than ten years ago, my son the fanatic did not attract much attention. Maybe it was that this story of a young British Muslim drawn into a world of fundamentalism and radicalism was just a little bit too strange, too exotic. Well, a lot has changed since then, and this movie is certainly topical, prophetic and urgent. Everything is mingling already together, this thing and the other. Some of us are wanting somewhat more besides muddle. What? Belief, purity. It's a story of Pervez, played by Om Puri, a great Indian actor in a marvelous performance. He's a cab driver, a Pakistani immigrant, trying to make a living and raise a family in an industrial northern British city. Here we'll be having my son's getting engaged party. He's marrying Madeleine. Madeleine Fingerhart, the top policeman's daughter. He impressed her no end. Pervez watches helplessly as his son Fareed changes from a guitar-playing university student with a white fiancé to a religious extremist. A transformation that's no doubt much scarier now than it was then. Isn't it written that you will respect your father? This is particularly difficult for Pervez, who has embraced many of the secular opportunities and pleasures of the West without quite giving up on some of his traditional beliefs, including, above all, the belief in his own paternal authority. But this is one aspect of tradition that Fareed, the son, unequivocally rejects. He sees his father as weak, hypocritical and corrupted by the West. It makes me feel sick to have such a father. I never thought you were such a man. Now, it is true that Pervez has been carrying on with a local prostitute, wonderfully played by Rachel Griffiths. And this relationship may be the most emotionally resonant in the film, but not because the other relationships aren't genuine. And this is the screenwriter Hanif Qureshi's great insight. People can be identified by recognizable sociological categories, but each one is still a unique, complicated individual. And so, in My Son the Fanatic, we have the hot-headed religious extremist, the dogmatic and severe imam, the anxious and disappointed mother, the hard-working immigrant father, and the hooker with a heart of gold. How do you feel about things? The purpose of life, all that? How we should treat each other? Good, I think. Where possible. The movie takes off from a somewhat familiar premise and develops some topical real-world themes. But Qureshi and the director Udayan Prasad are much more interested in real people and the essential messiness of human life. Remember two things. There are many ways of being a good man. And I will be at home. Will you come and see me? Now, My Son the Fanatic seems to foretell a lot of very terrible global things that happened after it was made. But it's a movie ultimately about how nothing that people do is predictable. What do you want?"

SYCD1IBzzC0,2731,"400 Blows, The (Les quatre cents coups) (1959)"," ... Toute la presse en est moins. Ce gosse vient de faire éclater une bombe. ... Les 400 coups, a dit Henry George Clouzot, est un film qui m'a positivement emballé. Le film le plus sensible que j'ai vu depuis la guerre. Quant à l'appréciation de Jean Cocteau, elle ne fut pas moins élogieuse. Je n'ai jamais été si bouleversé au cinéma. ... ... ... Oh, j'en ai assez ! Oh, je m'en fous ! Si tu ne peux pas te supporter, dis-le. On va le mettre chez les jésuites ou les enfants de troupes. J'ai pas le droit à la cote-câne ! Plus sévère pour la société que main réquisitoire. Bonjour, Madame ! Petit malheureux, va ! deposited Victoria Petit-Mélou. Interesting. Du casse-feu, également. La dernière nôtre. La Vamos-y ! Et voilà l' weniger salable ! Really, really, vehicle ! Bailey, Tissier, et Orwell ! chrome auntie ! et concerning artistes et artistes. Là ! Laquelle ? Il m'a sûrement vécu. Ton fils, celle qu'elle l'est. Qu'est-ce que tu vas prendre ? Une histoire prenante, sans révolte spectaculaire. Ainsi qu'en témoigne Paul Guilhom, dans France ce soir, le film a gagné tout simplement parce qu'il est beau comme tout ce qui va sans phrase jusqu'au bout de la vérité. Tes parents disent que tu mens tout le temps. Non, je mens de temps en temps. Des fois, je leur dirai des choses qui seraient la vérité et je préfère dire des mensonges. Au sujet de ce film, tout a été si spontanément et si exprimé jusqu'ici qu'on ne saurait rien y ajouter. Cette oeuvre apparaît comme la grande victoire d'une gageure tenue par ce jeune et féroce critique de cinéma qui a osé affronter le danger de la réciprocité en devenant à son tour metteur en scène. Ce film aura fait écrire à Jacqueline Michel et à la première fois, truffaut, a fait mieux qu'un chef-d'oeuvre, une oeuvre rigoureuse, vibrante, belle et sincère qui nous arrache le coeur doucement, tendrement, sans cris et sans grande illocence. Les 400 coups ont pour principale vedette Jean-Pierre Léo qui nous révèle un talent étonnant dans le rôle du gamin terrible de ce film. Les trois faits. Claire Morier, Albert Rémy et Guy Decomble. La recherche de l'absolu vous a conduit au zéro. Pour les autres moins familiers de Balzac, je dirais qu'il s'agit d'une ténébreuse affaire. Après ce coup-là, je ne peux plus vivre avec mes parents. Il faut que je disparaisse. Sous-titrage ST'501"
UkGFRwmakGQ,2732,Jules and Jim (Jules et Jim) (1961)," It's not Valentine's Day anymore, but love is still in the air, even if the candy is eaten and the flowers have wilted. Francois Truffaut's 1962 film Jules and Jim is certainly a movie about love, but it's not romantic in the conventional sense. It's the story of a love triangle with comic, even farcical elements and a decidedly tragic twist. It celebrates love, which turns out to be contradictory, complicated, and even dangerous. Oscar Werner and Henri Serre play Jules and Jim, two best buddies, one Austrian, one French, who fall in love with the same woman. Her name is Catherine, and you can't really blame them. She's played by the incomparably alluring Jean Moreau. The film explores both love affairs and the friendship between the two men against the backdrop of France in the decades before and after World War I. But even though it's set in the early part of the 20th century and was made almost 50 Jules and Jim feels as fresh and vibrant and new as if it was shot just last week. Part of this comes from the movie's frank, unsentimental presentation of friendship, sexual desire and love. Jules and Jim captures the experience of being young, caught up in the moment, not knowing quite what's going to come next. Even though it tells a coherent story and is based on a novel, the movie almost feels as if it's making itself up as it goes along. To achieve this spontaneity, Francois Truffaut uses an amazing array of cinematic techniques, sort of whatever comes to hand. Third person voice over narration, still images, inserted documentary footage, very fast cut montages and long takes that unfold as if they and we had all the time in the world. This kind of eclecticism is a hallmark of the French New Wave, a movement of young film geeks, maybe you know the type, who in the late 1950s and early 60s rejuvenated the art form. The love stories in Jules and Jim may be endlessly complicated, but the passion that animates this film is as simple as can be. It's Truffaut's love of cinema itself."

Fn02k1dx1Ns,2825,Rosie (1998), Hey guys this is George and I'm making this video because I want to review a movie that I feel is overlooked and I feel deserves more attention from people and the movie I'm going to be talking about is called Rosie. The movie came out in 1998 it was directed by Patrice Toy and it stars Aranka Coppens and the movie is about this girl who lives with her mother in Belgium and she has a really weird relationship with her family. Her mother doesn't want anybody to know that Rosie is her daughter and her uncle is just somebody who's taking advantage of Rosie's mother. She doesn't really care about anybody but himself and later as the movie continues Rosie starts to create a fantasy world in her mind and she does it as a way to escape all the problems that are going on around her. Then later Rosie's fantasies they start to become more crazy she starts to become more delusional and she starts to do things that many people would consider bad but in Rosie's mind she doesn't see anything she's doing as bad. She thinks that she's helping the people around her but she's actually making their lives worse and what I really liked about this movie besides the writing was the acting. A lot of the actors they seem like real everyday people and that really adds more to the movie. It makes the characters more believable and it makes everything seem more authentic in my opinion. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack the movie was scored by this guy named John Parrish and his music really added more to the movie. I think it made the movie seem much more darker and much more complex than it already was. I think his music really helped and it made the movie much better in my opinion. I also really appreciated the cinematography the movie had like this harsh bleak look to it but it was also really beautiful at the same time. I can't really explain it I think it was a perfect mixture of creamy images and really harsh bleak realism. I think that's the best way I could describe it. It's a really great movie I think the director she really took a chance and she really made a movie that was different and that stands out from most movies that came out in 1988. If anybody's interested you can find this movie on Amazon.com. I think it's actually really cheap but there's only like a few copies available. I actually bought this movie back in 2001. There's a VHS copy I bought at Blockbusters. I think it was like for probably like five bucks I think. I actually have the copy right here I want to show you guys real quickly. The front. I'll show you the back as well. Yeah so if you guys are interested I highly recommend checking this movie out if you have an open mind. Well that's pretty much my review for this movie. Thanks to whoever decided to watch this video and take care of yourselves. Bye.

With the help of NASA, the National Institute of Human Behavior, and Harvard Night School, we are going to attempt to show you this entire film in 15 seconds. If this process works, your brain should absorb all of the funniest moments without really knowing any of the story. And your desire to see the film in real time should, and I'm quoting our researchers here, go through the roof. Chills. Okay, those of you prone to seizures, now would be a good time to step out in the lobby and get a little more butter for your corn. Or you can look down at your shoes. And one last thing. We haven't perfected the audio part of this experiment yet, so I will be doing that live right here with my own mouth. Okay, here we go. I love that part. That was tough to shoot. Gee, Sharon's good there. Whoop. Well, there it is. Pretty damn funny, huh? I hate to toot my own horn, but have you ever seen me better? I don't think so. That's it. Now, according to our researchers, you should not only want to see this film in real time, you're actually going to have to. Your brain is now in what science calls a wound state. If you don't see this material slowly, you could go insane or die or even worse. Thank you very much. And by the way, this experiment, it doesn't just work for comedy. I saw Titanic last week in 11 seconds. Cried like a baby."

HE CHUCKLES Thank you for doing this. I don't think I could have done it on my own. I mean, I know they're just things, but, you know, it's psychologically. HE CHUCKLES I should have packed up Brendan's things a long time ago, but it's a hard thing to do on your own. Thanks, Sally. Look, if I'd done something bad, right, unintentionally, would you forgive me? What sort of bad? Well... Well, say... Say you were going to buy a house, right, and I sort of gazumped you without knowing it was you and then you found out that it was me. Oh, I think that would be OK. Yeah? Yeah."

pqmD3FWPajY,2863,"Hard Day's Night, A (1964)"," This is Trailers from Hell and I'm Alan Arkush. On August 11th, 1964, my life changed. I saw a movie that more than any other movie made me want to be a filmmaker. And that movie is the greatest rock and roll movie ever made in my opinion. It's Richard Lester's A Hard Day's Night. Are you ready? Just like the trailer says, I was filled with anticipation as I sat there in the packed Lee Theater in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Then that massive first chord hits, all the kids screamed and I was swept up into the world of John, Paul, George and Ringo. There is one moment for me that stands out above all the rest. The Beatles are on the train, locked in the cage in the baggage car with Paul's grandfather. John starts the harmonic intro for I Should Have Known Better. Guitars magically appear, teenage girls magically appear, and by mid-song, the screen cannot contain all that rock and roll joy. Then it happens. The handheld camera cannot resist the Beatles any longer. It starts bopping and dancing to the music. The fourth wall has been broken and I had an epiphany. I became aware of the filmmaking and thought, man, I'd love to do something like that someday. Richard Lester took another song, Can't Buy Me Love, and applied all the technique he had used in his short Running Jumping Standing Still. Jump cuts, speed changes and the sheer fun of being young and free. In fact, that's a theme throughout the movie. The Beatles burst out of rooms and run around and be young and free. Rock and roll movies would never be the same after that. United Artists was hoping for a quickie low budget programmer to exploit when they thought was just a passing fad. The Beatles thought differently and they did things their own way. They chose Richard Lester. He was young and they liked his style. So Lester and Alan Owen, the writer, went on tour with the Beatles, learned all about them, and the movie reflects the personalities of John, Paul, George and Ringo. The relationship with each other and their road managers and the fans. As a viewer, we come to believe this is how they actually are. And their attitudes towards the establishment and the world are who we really are, or rather, who we'd like to be. It was 90% scripted, but feels like the boys are making it up as it goes along. In fact, the movie was nominated for an Academy Award for its script. Lester wisely surrounded the band with characters sympathetic to their working rhythms. It all seems of a piece, shot quickly in seven weeks. They had to move quickly because when the fans discovered that the Beatles were shooting, they would mob the set. The band, throughout the movie, takes the piss out of all those pretentious people around them, busting those who dare to exploit them or challenge their integrity. The movie is full of memorable one-liners, banded about in conversations that are almost too witty and too fast to follow. But what stands out above everything else are those songs. Six of them were written for the movie, and at the end, there's lots and lots of them, a big concert. Ending with the big hits, big guitar strums, flying hair, and big drum fills, then the screen goes black. You realize it's the bottom of a helicopter, and the band flies away into the sky, leaving all of us viewers behind. I've never been in the same since. Hard Day's Night, probably my favorite movie of all time. Thanks for watching!"

awzTaOoZjUQ,2866,"Buddy Holly Story, The (1978)"," Oh boy, this is Josh Olson and it's Trailers from Hell and maybe baby we're gonna rave on and speak some words of love about the Buddy Holly story. That'll be the day. Just you know why Religious leaders say he's corrupting the youth of America Why you and I Psychologists feel he's creating mass hysteria This is Gary Busey in the role that made him a star. He got nominated for an Oscar and rightly so. It's kind of shocking when you look at it now because Busey is such a large guy, he's so massive, then Buddy Holly was so slight. But they caught Busey just at the right point, he still was slender and lithe enough to play the part and he pulls it off beautifully. It's a great performance. This is one of the first rock and roll movies, if not the first, by which I mean non-concert films, that recorded the music live on set as they shot the film. The actors were all musicians. Gary Busey of course was on vocals and guitar. Charles Martin Smith was on bass and Don Stroud played drums. And they played Buddy's songs on camera and they were really, really good. The nice advantage to shooting it that way is you actually catch the little mistakes that they make and it just adds to the veracity of the whole thing. It really feels real. The problem with a lot of rock and roll biopics is that most musicians and artists tend not to live very eventful external lives. A perfect example of that would be Buddy Holly. He was a guy with a perfectly normal life who just happened to conceive and record some radical, revolutionary, world-changing music, then got on the wrong plane and died. What makes Buddy Holly remarkable is the amazing music. He was the first rock and roller to write, arrange, and produce his own stuff. His life was not so much. He grew up, had some nice parents, met a nice girl, fell in love, got married. And yet somehow the interesting thing about this film is they manage to tell Buddy's story in a way that makes it compelling and interesting without changing the facts particularly. I don't really know how they did it and I kind of wish they did because theoretically I write and make films myself and they seem to have cracked the code. Part of it though is Busey's performance. He's absolutely amazing. He inhabits Buddy Holly. The great music certainly helps. A personal note, the very first rock and roll concert I ever went to in my life was Bruce Springsteen in Philadelphia, Darkness on the Edge of Town Tour. And I had just seen the Buddy Holly story and I knew a little bit about Holly going in but I walked out a huge fan. And a couple weeks later I was at the Spectrum in Philly having the most amazing experience of my life and one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. And about halfway through the show Bruce brought out Gary Busey and they played Rave On together. It's still one of the greatest things I've ever seen in my life."

It's incredibly painful and romantic about unfulfilled love, about a love that cannot be, which reminds me of lobster actually. It's a universe, you know that's a 1940s England where there are huge obstacles in the way of someone just running off with a married man or woman. And same with lobster, there are lots of rules which means that you can't just cavort off with whoever you like whenever you like. You have to be totally synchronized. Five, four, three, two.

AdKxPTgo-Qw,2930,Return with Honor (1998)," Why is honor so important? To be a patriot, what does that mean anymore to be a patriot? Does that mean just to go out and protest and spout off cliches such as land of the free, home of the brave, and those kind of things? No, it means get out there and do something honorable. Putting a bumper sticker on your car doesn't qualify. We have focused so far inward that we have forgotten that we're community. Do people actually sit and think about honor anymore? Or are they too busy listening to their iPod or texting to even think about why they're able to even sit here uninterrupted, sit here without fear of being blown up, fear of being shot at? It's time for this country to take a moment and take a break from the economy and say, you know what? It's time to honor our men and women who have given so much, some family who lost a soldier. What have you done to honor them? I don't know how we would exist as a nation if we don't show honor and take pride in our soldiers in this case and honor them and honor their service. Why would anybody want to put his life on the line for people who didn't care? I don't know and I don't think they would. They deserve honor above all as far as I'm concerned. There are people out there wanting to take us down and wanting to end our way of life and these guys and gals are willing to stand up in the face of that enemy and put their life on the line and if you can't honor that, I don't know what's going to happen to this country. Everybody says we support the troops. What does that mean? Do you buy a little yellow ribbon and stick it on the back of your vehicle that was probably made in China? It's easy. We need to show these people that we have not forgotten them, that they are loved and appreciated. We understand where our freedom comes from. No matter what we do for these soldiers, no matter what we can do for their families, it's not enough. We can always do more. This is our chance to honor them and honor the sacrifices they as families have made, not just the soldier, but the families that have lost daddy or brother or uncle. You don't realize this affects a family down several generations. Petty Officer Schwedler, Petty Officer Joseph Schwedler, Petty Officer Joseph C. Schwedler, John 15, 13, greater love hath no man than this to lay down his own life for his friends. We honor you as comrades, patriots, warriors. We will never forget your ultimate sacrifice. When we honor the sacrifices of these wounded soldiers, you can see the change in their countenance. You know, these soldiers are some of the most humble men and women that we have ever run across. They'll be thanking us for what we do for them, you know, to honor them. Well, the fact of the matter is it's kind of hard to accept thanks from a soldier who's standing there on a prosthetic device, you know, who has given up a leg and he's 19 years old and forever will be walking around on a prosthetic leg. We honor their service and their sacrifice. Their sacrifice goes on and on and on. You know, we'll go back to our lives pretty much after Warriors Weekend, but when they return home, they carry theirs with them. We don't forget that. We don't take it lightly."

6ldXWxN6gZs,2935,"Lady Eve, The (1941)"," Hi, I'm Alan Arkish and this is Trailers from Hell. Preston Sturges. I love Preston Sturges. The Lady Eve is one of my top 10 all-time favorite movies. Now Preston Sturges' life kind of reads like he's a character in his own pictures. As a young boy, he and his free-spirited mother used to celebrate the springtime rite of Bacchus, the god of wine. In fact, the young Preston had to be taken to the hospital once with champagne poisoning. As he grew older, he became interested in science and inventing. He created kiss-proof lipstick. You can't make this stuff up. He made a small fortune, moved to New York City, where he was involved in a terrible car accident. He was in a cab and he was laid out flat and was on his back for four or five months. And that's when he started to write. And being the kind of person that he was, he wrote a Broadway play that became a hit, which is how he got out to Hollywood and on the Paramount lot, where he became one of the top writers. But he never liked what the other directors, what the directors were doing with his material. So the great McGinty. And he became the first writer-director of the sound era. As an auteur, his reputation has continued to grow. His originality, his wit, his fast-paced style are really highly thought up today. You can walk into any writer's room in TV today, mention the name Preston Sturges, and everyone uses him as a reference point. They all know who he is. From 1940 to 1944, get this, he wrote and directed eight movies, two of which are masterpieces. Sullivan's Travels and our trailer from Hell, The Lady Eve. Who is the Lady Eve? Sturges wrote the part for Barbara Stanwyck. In the script, she has two distinct personalities, the sharp, fast-talking Grifter Gene and the royal Lady Eve. Stanwyck plays both with equal aplomb. I agree with most film historians who feel that she is based on Sturges' bohemian mother, Mary Desti. She was a fashion designer and the traveling companion of the legendary dancer Isadora Duncan. With the young Preston in tow, they tour Europe in a grand style by living off the kindness of wealthy men. Two quotes from the movie describe his mother well. A beautiful woman can get anything she wants, and as Eve so profoundly puts it, the good girls aren't half as good as you think, and the bad girls aren't nearly half so bad. Now meet Barbara Stanwyck, his very, very vexing Lady Eve, bewitching, bewildering, and very bothering to Henry Fonda, a modern Adam. He cast Henry Fonda for the part of Charles Pike, the owner of Pike's Pail, the ale that won for Yale, rah, rah, rah. He was the perfect foil, and in his desire to merge literate dialogue and slapstick, he made Fonda take about a dozen pratfalls, no doubles allowed. Sturges wrote his scripts by dictating the dialogue to his secretary as he acted out all the parts in the voices of each character. Of course, he surrounded his stars with his usual stock company. William Demarest, Eugene Paulette, and Charles Coburn give definitive performances. From all reports, it was a very happy set. Stanwyck said that if Capra's set was hushed like a cathedral, Sturges was like a carnival. Peter Bogdanovich thinks that the Lady Eve is a definitive romantic screwball comedy. I agree. There may be a few comedies as good, but none are better. Now they actually trained the snake, and Edith had made a hat and a coat, but the snake wouldn't wear it."
KIfH8i9FtCA,2936,Sullivan's Travels (1941)," Hi, I'm Mick Garris. Class is in session. Welcome to Trailers from Hell. Today's trailer is not really from hell, it's really from heaven. It's for what might be my favorite movie of all time by Preston Sturges. It's Sullivan's Travels. Nobody wrote dialogue like Preston Sturges. And he became not only one of the highest paid and most successful, but really one of the most artistic and talented writers the movies have ever known. So Sturges kind of changed the course of Hollywood history when he had written a screenplay called The Great McGinty at the height of his powers as a screenwriter and offered to sell it to the studio for one dollar, but only if he could direct. During his tenure as a screenwriter and as a director, he was hired to do rewrites and polishes on things like College Swing, the Broadway Melody of 1940, and those were brilliantly satirized in this movie as titles like Ants in Your Pants of 1938 that the hero Sullivan has to make his living doing when he really wants to make a serious film called Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? which was nicely co-opted by the Coen brothers. Joel McCrae was the perfect leading man. He's smart and strong and you know, looks like a real human being. He wasn't Cary Grant. He was something a little scruffier and a little tougher and he was also great in the Palm Beach story. And Sturges would always have his stock company along. There would be William Demeris, Franklin Pangborn, Jimmy Conlon, Charles Moore, all these guys who were in almost all of the movies and that's one of the most fun things about watching a Sturges movie."
c5CzAFYj7Nw,2937,"Palm Beach Story, The (1942)"," I'm Mick Garris and this is Trailers from Hell and this time we're going to move away from my usual world of monsters and madmen and mayhem and instead talk about one of my favorite comedies from the 1940s from my favorite filmmaker Preston Sturgis. This is 1942's The Palm Beach Story. In the 1940s Preston Sturgis was the biggest director of comedies, a guy whose name was in all of the advertising of his movies including this one. His first success was as a Broadway playwright but became one of the great writer directors in American film history. I love trailers that were made specifically to address the audience rather than just scenes cut from the film. William Demarest here was one of Sturgis' company of regular players in many of his films, though they had a falling out later in Sturgis' career when his meteoric success started to plummet as quickly as it rose. Preston Sturgis was the first of the writer directors, an auteur before the theory existed. Sturgis had a very unique youth raised by his eccentric mother, the self-named Mary Desti, who led the life of a bohemian artist long before such things were socially acceptable. She moved to Paris when Preston was three years old to pursue a career as a singer, created exotic cosmetics and befriended the famous dancer Isadora Duncan. She even gave her the scarf that ended up strangling her to death when it caught in the spokes of a car she was riding in. Preston's mother also had a romantic relationship with Aleister Crowley. So Sturgis came by his unique worldview and writing style, naturally. Nobody wrote funnier dialogue than Preston Sturgis in Palm Beach Story along with the Lady Eve in Sullivan's Travels as proof. His writing was a rare and always successful combination of sophisticated wordplay and shameless slapstick and pratfalls. His casts were always peopled by unusual but relatable central characters and oddball supporting casts. The Weenie King here in Palm Beach Story is one of the great comedic characters in film history. Sturgis always got the best out of his cast and Joel McCrae, who worked with him in Sullivan's Travels as well, and Claudette Colbert are at their zenith here. It's one of the funniest movies of all time. It makes the crash of his career all the more heartbreaking. Howard Hughes wooed Sturgis away from the studios with an offer to go independent. It was the beginning of the end for Sturgis, whose career never rebounded. It was a personal and career decline and his fortunes dwindled as his troubles with alcohol and his marriages and personal relationships sadly ebbed."

yD6rY2k3Dzk,2968,Time Bandits (1981)," I thought what a great thing to design. It had all these elements, you know, it had all these time periods and you know, a bit of fantasy at the end and it had, it had, you know, had a great story and it had great jokes. It was a gift for a designer. I think we had about 12 weeks pre-production. We had a little office and I started drawing. I had two wonderful assistants and they were researching and we really just put our heads down and went for it. Millie Burns was introduced to Gilliam through editor Julian Doyle, who had seen her innovative work on a Lux soap commercial shot in Italy on a tiny budget. Burns was hired as the art director for Jabberwocky before being offered the chance to design Time Bandits. It's a designer's dream, Time Bandits. It's all those different periods, fantasy, ancient Greece, medieval, Napoleonic, I mean, and Terry, what could you want? The thing is, some people think that you design a film and then you make it. Of course you don't. It's an organic process. And you're always trying to run one step ahead. So you've designed something, they're shooting that and you're getting the next bit ready and so it goes on. For each of the six Time Bandits, as well as a seventh, Horse Flesh, whose role was cut back in the final film, Acheson had to come up with distinctive designs to help differentiate the characters for the audience. Costume is hopefully about reflecting character. You know, it's supporting, that's what clothes on films do. They support the performance. I started designing the costumes before we had the actors. And so it was a very nice two-way process. We assembled a kind of arsenal of clothes from different periods, different things that we thought might be useful. We got the little people to come in to the fitting and then we would close them. One of the Time Bandits would look at the drawing and realize that he could work with that. We could pad him out a little bit more to make him a little bit dumpier. Og was kind of rather silly, not the sharpest tool in the toolbox character. So, you know, he had only one horn on his Viking helmet. He was a little bit rotund and nothing quite worked. Oh, stop! Whereas the leader, you know, wore a kind of military uniform, we changed him a lot from the original drawings. He ended up with goggles and a kind of Biggles type feel to his head gear and a little red jacket that had military bearing, boldricks and a monocle. So he had a sort of slightly imperious feel. And as we collected these bits and pieces, the actors were able to use them and find their character sometimes through the things they were wearing and the things they were using."
ERe7FGUEtE8,2969,"Man and a Woman, A (Un homme et une femme) (1966)"," Et votre mari est original ? Pour moi oui. Il est si passionnant, si exclusif, si entier. Il se passionne pour des choses, pour des gens, pour des idées, pour des pays. Mais dites-moi c'est le Christ ? Pour moi peut-être. Par exemple, j'ai vécu une semaine au Brésil sans jamais y avoir été. Pierre a tourné un film là-bas. À son retour, il m'a parlé de la samba pendant une semaine. La samba a été entrée dans notre vie. La samba a été entrée dans notre vie ? Oui. Être heureux c'est plus ou moins ce qu'on cherche. J'aime rire, chanter. Et je n'empêche pas les gens qui sont bien d'être joyeux. Pourtant s'il est une samba sans tristesse, c'est un vin qui ne donne pas libresse. Un vin qui ne donne pas libresse. Non ce n'est pas la samba que je veux. Faire une samba sans tristesse, c'est aimer une femme qui ne serait que belle. Ce sont les propres paroles de Vinicius de Morais. Vinicius de Morais, haut étudiant, auteur de cette chanson. Et comme il le dit lui-même, le blanc le plus noir du Brésil. Moi qui suis peut-être le français le plus brésilien de France, j'aimerais vous parler de mon amour de la samba. Comme un amoureux qui n'osant pas parler à celle qu'il aime, en parlerait à tous ceux qu'il rencontre. J'en connais que la chanson incomode d'autres pour qu'il ne sonne rien. Qu'une mode d'autre qui en profite sans l'aimer. Moi je l'aime et j'ai parcouru le monde en cherchant ses racines vagabondes. Aujourd'hui pour trouver les plus profondes, c'est la samba-chanson qu'il faut chanter. Joan Gilbert, Carlos Lyra, Dorival Caymmi, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, Baden-Powell, qui a fait la musique de cette chanson et de tant d'autres. Vous avez mon salut. Ce soir je voudrais voir jusqu'à l'ivresse, pour mieux délirer sur tous ceux que grâce à vous j'ai découvert et qui ont fait de la samba ce qu'elle aime. Sarabah. Beijing, Noël Rosa, Dolores Durand, Silvio Monteiro et tant d'autres. Et tous ceux qui viennent, Edou Lobo. Et mes amis qui sont avec moi ce soir. Baden bien sûr, Ico, Osvaldo, Luigi, Oscar, Nicolino, Milton, Sarabah. Tous ceux-là qui font qu'il est un mot que plus jamais je ne pourrais prononcer sans frissonner. Un mot qui secoue tout un peuple en le faisant chanter. Les mains levées au ciel, samba. On m'a dit qu'elle venait de Bahia, qu'elle doit s'enrythmer sa poésie à des siècles de danse et de douleur. Mais quel que soit le sentiment qu'elle exprime, elle est blanche de formes et de rimes. Blanche de formes et de rimes, elle est nègre, bien nègre dans son cœur. Mais quel que soit le sentiment qu'elle exprime, elle est blanche de formes et de rimes. Blanche de formes et de rimes, elle est nègre, bien nègre dans son cœur.

g07TJ-QDY8s,2971,All That Jazz (1979)," Hello, I'm Alan Arkush and this is Trailers from Hell. The personal cinema, movies that delve deeply into the life of the filmmaker, are rare in Hollywood. What do you call the movie equivalent of a Romano clef? Because that's what we have here today. A barely fictionalized autobiography of the life of Bob Fosse. One of the most personal movies ever made. Something that occurred to me as I read this excellent biography of Fosse by Sam Wasson. It's all here. All the real-life events that are echoed in the movie. In 1973, Fosse won an Oscar for Cabaret, an Emmy for Liza with the Z, and a Tony for Pippin. This trifecta drove him into a deep depression and a near fatal heart attack. His life is exposed for all to see in our trailer from Hell, 1979's All That Jazz. Candy Casey, very good. You're gonna do it again, Victoria. This is not a very good trailer, probably because the studio didn't know how to deal with the movie as original as this one. A movie that's often nonlinear and impressionistic. A bearing of the soul. A truth-telling full of the people and experiences that shape Fosse's life. Growing up, he idolized Fred Astaire and wanted to be him. Failing that, his work as a choreographer has left a lasting mark on dance history. The thrilling opening of the movie is a musical exegesis of the Broadway dance audition process that seamlessly introduces us to all the main characters and gives us a real insight into the Fosse character, Joe Gideon. It's practically a movie unto itself, brilliantly edited by Allen Hine. The music numbers are of course all great, but it's take off with us. A depiction of coast-to-coast sex that's the real showstopper. The story arc of its creation is central to the plot of the movie. Roy Scheider plays Joe Gideon as a tortured soul who is never satisfied, never happy, never good enough. In dress, mannerism, and nuance, he is a doppelganger for Fosse. All That Jazz is an important milestone in the history of movie musicals. Along with Amadeus and the Red Shoes, it's a big statement about the dedication, monomania, and obsession that creativity demands of those geniuses give their lives to making personal art."

iMtSqdRoagw,3061,Holiday Inn (1942)," [""The Christmas Song""] A lot of holiday movies are preachy and earnest. They're designed to teach important lessons about the true meaning of Christmas. Holiday Inn is not one of those movies. It's a pure confectionary diversion. This movie came out in 1942, in the anxious first year of America's involvement in World War II, and it leveraged the star power of two of the biggest celebrities of the time, Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, and also brought in one of the great songwriters of the era, Irving Berlin, who contributed more than a dozen original numbers to this movie. Above all, one that would become a great classic. [""The Christmas Song""] Now, this movie does have a plot. It involves the partnership and sometimes romantic rivalry between Jim and Ted. Jim is Bing Crosby. Ted is Fred Astaire. They're partners in a vaudeville act, and then Jim decides he's going to retire and has the wonderful idea of opening up a nightclub that will only be open on the holidays. Now, this is not perhaps the most practical business plan, but it does give the movie a certain structure, which is musical and dance numbers, each one pegged to a different holiday. So you have the Washington's birthday production number, the Fourth of July production number, of course, the Christmas and New Year's production numbers, and especially, and from our point of view perhaps somewhat disturbingly, the Abraham Lincoln's birthday number. [""That's Why We Celebrate This Blessed February Day""] Now, obviously this kind of thing dates the film somewhat and makes it unpalatable to current sensitivities, but it's important to remember that this movie is more than 65 years old, and it's also a valuable movie because it's really part of a tradition of holiday popular culture, of disposable popular art, some of which turns out to really have lasting interest and value. You have Fred Astaire, who's perhaps the greatest dancer we've ever seen on film, Bing Crosby, a wonderful cooner, and these fantastic songs by Irving Berlin, surely one of the great American composers. But the point of this movie is not to remind you of the true meaning of Christmas or of anything else. It's more to remind you of the true value of entertainment. It celebrates the idea of a holiday as a time where you get to have some fun, where you get to take a break, where whatever troubles are going on in your life or in the world, you can have a drink, eat some nice food, sing, dance, have a good time."

Tora, Tora, Tora, an unprecedented film bringing you answers to one of the most controversial mysteries of our age. How could the attack on Pearl Harbor have happened? Colonel sir, if we do spot something, what do we do? Report it to headquarters, dammit. How sir? We haven't got a telephone, sir. There's a gasoline station about a mile down the road. They must have a phone. Why was one nation unprepared while another was geared for war? Why did the plan for the sneak attack split the Japanese high command wide open? The fleet should have stayed in San Diego where it belongs. I made the mistake of pointing that out to Roosevelt. Why was Admiral Yamamoto marked for assassination by the Japanese warlords? Does anybody trust anybody anymore? Why was the President of the United States office considered a security risk? How did the Japanese rehearse their doomsday attack on Pearl Harbor? Damn it, why can't Washington give us the full inside story? Why did they keep the American command in the dark? What part was played by the strange Japanese officer they called Gandhi?

But to find the real thing, you must come to Lael, the wholesale food market, the stomach of Paris. And if Lael is the stomach of Paris, then its busiest street, the Rue Casanova, is the heart of Paris, a place of passion, bloodshed, desire and death, everything in fact that makes life worth living.

L'incontro con De Sica non ce l'ho mai avuto. Il giorno appresso venne a fare i provini dove abitavo io, al Colosseo, in via Capodafica. Io abitavo via Capodafica, il Colosseo e lui venne a fare i provini proprio dove, nel portone dove io poi ero entrato, sapeva che stavo lì. Stava facendo i provini a tutti i bambini, era fasti 5000 in tutta Italia e io sono andato a vederlo. Ho rivisto De Sica. Ho detto, allora, però non è che conoscevo De Sica, però non pensavo più a queste cose. Lui si avvicinò e mi disse, è lui. Io non avevo fatto nessun provino. Dice, no, no, lui, vuoi andare via. E aveva scelto anche Enzo Cerusico. E allora abbiamo lavorato insieme un mese, io e Enzo Cerusico, facevamo sempre le stesse scene. Una io e l'altra ripeteva. Finché poi hanno deciso di scegliere me e a lui hanno regalato una bicicletta. Io volevo una bicicletta perché da bambino pensavo di avere una bicicletta. Invece cominciai a lavorare così.

moYyyHMdOdw,3096,My Man Godfrey (1957)," Hey there everybody, thanks for joining us tonight on TCM. I'm Ben Mankiewicz. In 1936, William Powell and Carol Lombard teamed up to make one of the best comedy dramas of the 1930s, My Man Godfrey. Two years later, Powell and Lombard recreated their roles in a radio version of the story, this time with a young emerging actor named David Niven taking on a key supporting part. Two decades later, Universal International remade My Man Godfrey, this time with Niven as the star, playing the role Powell played on screen 21 years earlier. And the remake is the film we have coming up next. It's from 1957, My Man Godfrey. The story is based on the screenplay of the original 1936 film written by Morrie Riskin and Eric Hatch, which was based on Hatch's novel. But for the remake, Universal hired a new writing team that varied the story in a few places. In this adaptation, Niven plays an Austrian diplomat who feels the need to hide out in the U.S. He soon crosses paths with an unusual rich lady, played by June Allison, who assumes Niven is a vagrant. When he helps her win a scavenger hunt, she's so impressed with him that she offers him a job as a butler to her eccentric family. He accepts and then immediately must work overtime to maintain his cover while putting up with all the antics of the nutty household. Niven and Allison were not Universal's first choices for the leading roles. Niven replaced a German actor, O.W. Fisher, who turned out to be much more trouble than he was worth. More on that after the movie. And June Allison, she stepped in for Doris Day because the studio was not prepared to meet Day's salary demands. From director Henry Koster in 1957, with a theme sung by Sarah Vaughn. Here's my man Godfrey."

All those things made me actually love her very much and realized that rather than a psychopathic villain, she was somebody out of control and in great need of help.

stcLNLMMCO4,3110,Country (1984)," Alright, I want to take the time out here to do a quick movie review. About, gosh, weeks and weeks ago now, my wife and I bought a movie called Country. It's from 1984, features Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard. The main reason why we bought it is because a fellow YouTuber that most of you guys who are going to watch this will recognize, Golden Demonstrator. This movie was actually filmed on location at his grandfather's farm in Iowa. His grandfather obviously used his farm and everything. His dad, Kenny's dad, actually got to spend a little time with Sam Shepard and show him how to run the combine at the beginning of the film. My favorite part of the movie is the beginning of the film. There's quite a bit of farming going on there. That's just my personal favorite part. The movie is based on the 80s. The early 80s was a tough time for our country as far as lots of things go. The automotive industry was bad. The construction industry was bad. The farming industry was bad, which all three of those pretty much hit my family pretty hard as well. This movie pretty much goes off of the basics of the farming end of it. It's a great story. It tells a true story as far as what went on with the banks, mainly the FHA then and the government trying to take over farmers and some problems with financial loans. I remember some things when I was a kid. This movie, I was probably only five or six years old, so I don't remember seeing it. I had a vibe to see it again. When I was a young kid, I remember my dad telling me and my grandfather telling me stories about how some of the local farmers around our area were being sent letters and told that they had to pay their loans off in 30 days or else they were going to lose everything. I remember some of these things. I know some of the older guys on here will remember it probably better than I do. Our family was not affected by that. However, our family, we've always worked two jobs. My grandfather was in the automotive industry, my dad automotive industry, my uncle was in the construction industry, and we all farmed after that. All three of those industries were bad in the early 80s and up to the mid-80s. It was a tough time for everybody. This is a good movie. If you guys want to get it, you're going to pay hell getting it. I know we did. We had to order it online, and it took forever for it to get here. That's the only way you're going to be able to find it, too, more likely. Anyway, quick movie review. Thanks for watching. If you guys want to watch this movie, I recommend it. Any questions, you can probably ask me or ask Kenny. Send him a message. Thanks."

cS4XGbu3NT4,3176,"Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)"," Hi, I'm Dan Ireland. This is Trailers from Hell. One of Roger Ebert's other favorite films happened to be a very favorite film of mine, The Talented Mr. Ripley. I think it's probably one of Anthony Mangela's best films, if not his best film. I was never a fan of the English patient, and I went into this film very reluctantly. And by the end of it, I was completely dazzled. And I'm also a fan of Purple Noon. So for me to go into this film and actually come out of it and like it the first time was something. I've seen it approximately six or seven times, and it only gets better. NOMINATED FOR FIVE ACADEMY AWARDS Nominated for five Academy Awards, the film boasts one of the most impressive casts that you could possibly imagine, except at the time, I guess it didn't really seem that impressive. Matt Damon probably gives a career-best performance in this, and he was the guy that got attacked the most by the critics. But if you watch this again, he's never given a performance as deep or as subtle or as disaffecting. But the guy that stole the show was Jude Law, because he had the showy, showy role of Dickie Greenleaf. And Jude Law, again, had never been better in a film before or since this. And really, if you see this film for nothing else, you should see it for Jude Law and Matt Damon's performances. But to top it off, there's Gwyneth Paltrow, there's Cate Blanchett in a role that's really kind of supporting, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. All of them are just at their best. The film is a thriller, but it's more a meditation on evil. And Anthony Mengele really reached deep into his cinematic sphere and made this one of the most beautiful and sumptuous films. The score by Gabrielle Yarad is absolutely haunting, and the cinematography by John Seale is also one of the things that just create the atmosphere about this film. The more I watch it, the more I can see the tension in it, building and building and building, to a point where it absolutely grabs you by the throat. I know a lot of people don't like this film. I love it. If you get a chance, check out The Talented Mr. Ripley. Thank you for watching!"

WtxXTxKmNxs,3187,Trans (1998)," Hey guys, this is George and I'm making this video because I want to review a movie that I've never really seen that many people review. And the name of the movie I'm going to be reviewing is called Trans. Trans is a movie that came out in 1998. It was directed by a guy named Julian Goldberger and it stars Ryan Daugherty. And the movie is basically about this kid who's in a juvenile detention center in Florida. And he's feeling really suicidal and miserable and he just mostly wants to leave and just be free. And then one day when he's out doing trash pick up with some of the other kids from the juvenile detention center, there's a fight and during that fight, he decides to run off with some other kids and while he's on the run, he meets up with people from his past as well as other people. But he doesn't really seem to have a plan, he mostly just wants to be free and look for his mother. And what I really liked about this movie is that it was mostly improvised, there wasn't really anything that was scripted. And I really liked that because it wasn't predictable and the people that were involved in the movie were taking a lot of chances and they were doing things differently. You wouldn't really see most filmmakers do nowadays. I mean, people would rather play it safe. I really like people that like to challenge other people and do their own thing. I also really liked the cinematography, the movie was shot in a very surreal, dreamlike way and it just really caught my eye and I just really appreciated it. I also liked the fact that I was able to connect and relate to the main character. I guess because when I was younger, I felt very alienated and I can really connect with most people around me. I guess that's probably one of the main reasons I watched this movie so many times. And I really liked the soundtrack as well, most of the songs in the movie really complement the scenes really well. Some of the people on the soundtrack are Fat Mama and their Trans-World Orchestra, the Mondo family, there's a few other people as well. At first I didn't know that the songs were included in the DVD, the person who told me that, I think his YouTube name is Peter Normis and he actually posted most of the songs on YouTube if anybody's interested. This movie is actually really cheap, you can get it on Amazon.com for like $2 or $3. I actually bought this movie back in 1999, or I think it might have been 2000. It was a used VHS copy, I bought it Blockbuster. I have a copy right here if you guys want to look at it. I have a DVD as well, I'm going to show you guys that too. Well that's pretty much my review for this movie, thanks to whoever decided to watch this video and take care of yourselves. Bye."

Stay Each day Is Valentine's Day Now that we've gotten this far, I suppose you think that the plural of mouse is mouses. It is mice, and here are some dandy examples.

I'll give you an example. Yes, sir, that is a gasser. In the form of Rita Hayward. In some form that gasser has. Any questions? That's how Joey keeps loose, and is always poppin'. Knock, knock, knock. You see, Joey has a good reason to be poppin'. Now, studying a case's history of Joey, you must know his philosophy. You treat a dame like a lady, and treat a lady like a dame. She gets too hungry For dinner at eight She likes the theater Never comes late She'd never bother With people she'd hate That's why the lady is a tramp Did you get the message? Yeah, Joey's quite a guy. He's the brainchild of John O'Hara, and Rodgers and Hart put words and music to him for a Broadway hit musical. And wrote one of their greatest scores, plus a few added R&H starters. Listen. I didn't know what time it was Till I met you There is a small hotel With a wishing well If they ask me I could write a book About the way you walk And whisper and look I've slipped again I've tripped again The way to my heart Is unzipped again Bewitched Bothered And bewildered And I'm out That's why the lady That's why the lady That's why the lady is a tramp This is the master suite.

Then he also explained why he wanted me to do that. He says, because, Jackie, it's this little boy who's being torn from his friend. And as he started to dramatize it, I saw it in my mind's eye. He was a marvelous storyteller, narrator, but he put it on an intensely personal basis. So that when he said camera and then action, and the welfare worker threw me into this truck, I was really gone. And I was torn up. I want my daddy, and I was hysterical.

When the five member nations of the Security Council were confirmed to have nuclear arsenals, it was assumed they would never be used. Deterrence was our global shield. We are now getting word from our correspondents that the United Nations led American peacekeeping force has been overrun. Suppose you tell me why I'm hearing about the start of World War III on the television. We're also getting reports from the Pikes Peak area that there was a huge snowstorm. That's where the President is of course. Where are we? Diner. No, no. Town, town. Aztec, Colorado. Home of the screaming beavers. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. Here we go. Unless your leader immediately withdraws from his position... I will authorize the dropping of a multi-megaton nuclear device. What you are about to do is not in your best interest or that of the country. The fact that the United States would launch a nuclear attack, particularly when it must be initiated and completed in less than an hour and a half, is very limiting. Let's be clear. If we attack, we attack and it's going to be made. There's going to be nothing left. No rebuilding, no aid, nothing. We must meet our terms unconditionally in just under 40 minutes. Send the B-2. We're going to let her fly. I'm going to let them fly. That's illegal. Am I missing something? You dropped that bomb. You got my vote and the vote of every real American. The idea of warfare is not about gambling. It's about certainty. Strategic certainty. Moral certainty. Do I seem uncertain to you? I have four minutes to acquire those codes. What I need is for you to set aside your personal feelings and do your job. This is the bomber that our forces in the Pentagon are telling us will be used to carry and drop nuclear weapons.

This is a love story unlike any other. It's titled... Splendor in the Grass. It starts out like this. Whether you live in a Kansas town the way they do, or in a city, or anywhere, it makes no difference. This is the time you'll understand when suddenly the kissing isn't a kid's game anymore.

Tell me the truth, Wilma Dean. No, Mom, we haven't gone too far. I think she's disgraceful. The way she stands there waiting for the players. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There isn't any reason in the world why I should speak to her. You were more than speaking to her. What do you mean? You think I'm supposed to not notice her? Is that what you expect out of me? I'm not even supposed to know girls like that exist, huh? I don't blame anyone, Mother. I raised you the only way I knew how, Deanie. The way my mother raised me, and I suppose the way her mother raised her. I always believed she was right about things. Maybe she wasn't. I loved her. I love you, Mother. I hope so, Deanie. This is a love story unlike any other. Splendor in the grass. This is a story about the many aspects of love, about love fulfilled and love denied, and about love's desperate alternatives. This is a love story about a boy and a girl deeply unredeemed. This is a love story about a boy and a girl deeply unredeemably, gloriously and hopelessly in love. A love story unlike any other.

DZOeXQjDbAM,3339,Cross of Iron (1977)," In this century of great wars, no other compares to the mammoth struggle between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. From this savage era comes a story so big that only the epic camera of Sam Peckinpah could do justice to its theme. As the once invincible German army was hammered back in the year after Stalingrad, survival came to depend on two kinds of soldier. Leaders of men such as Steiner and seekers of glory such as Stransky. Why did you ask to be relieved from duty in France? I want to get the iron cross. Steiner is a myth, but men like him are our last hope. I firmly don't believe that the ideals of the German soldier, even a German soldier, still can't ask any ideals. He's fighting for his life. If they're the last of us, Scrantzy and Steiner, then God help us. There are orders that no Russian prisoners are to be taken. Rid of him. How, sir? Shoot him. You shoot him, sir. The German soldiers are coming. The German soldiers are coming. The German soldiers are coming. The German soldiers are coming. Not since All Quiet on the Western Front has any film probed the realities of war so deeply. Whatever Sam Peckinpah does generates an excitement of its own. The need to find love. Good-bye. And the inner conflict to face death instead. Now, Sam Peckinpah achieves a new high with cross of iron. Why do you want it so badly? As he looks beyond the mere winning of medals to the meaning of courage itself. It's just a piece of woodless metal. It's not worthless to me. You're not dealing with just another Nazi party type. He doesn't live in the same world we live in. I know, he's living in my world now. They're pulling back to the bridgehead at Kuban. No rear guard, not even standards, B'Toon. Regimental headquarters, come in, please. Scrantzy, can you hear me? All the lines are out. The only person that stands between Scrantzy and this iron cross? Without Steiner to contradict him, he'll get his iron cross. Scrantzy in Paris, Steiner, God knows where he'll be. Even bigger than the wild bunch. More exciting than straw dogs and the getaway. Now, Sam Peckinpah brings you the most epic story of them all. Cross of iron. You're leaving without your iron cross, Captain? I said, where's the rest of your platoon? Sergeant Steiner! Captain Scrantzy, you are the rest of my platoon. I'll show you how a Prussian officer can fight. Then I will show you where the iron cross has grown. The End"

88Fb2J5C30Y,3364,"Asphalt Jungle, The (1950)"," Hi, my name is Michael Layman and this is Trailers from Hell. Today we're going to talk about The Asphalt Jungle, a great film by John Huston. It holds up incredibly well. It's lots of fun, extremely well made, a classic of film noir but better than all those film noir movies that everybody else likes. This one is really fantastic. One of the funny things about this trailer is they sell the movie as if it's a literary event and in fact what's fun about it is it's a good crime drama. It's a caper film and what makes it so good is the characters and the performance. I suppose then it makes some sense they're selling this as if it's a high quality literary film and they've got quotes from writers which is very funny but in fact this movie is completely fun to watch. It's fun to watch because it has a great performance by Sterling Hayden in the lead. Great meaning wooden and stiff and entirely unconvincing but absolutely perfect for the role and a great lead in to the roles he did later for Stanley Kubrick in The Killing and Doctor Strangelove. It also has fantastic supporting parts. I particularly love Louis Calhurn as Emmerich, a wealthy man who's going broke and is trying to rip off these guys who are pulling a heist for him. He's shot from the side all the time so that his nose looks bigger. You can even see it in the trailer. They just got that big nose there. There are a lot of profile shots in this movie. It's really amazing and Sam Jaffe who plays Doc Riedenschneider I think it is who is setting up this caper puts in a terrific performance with a funny halting walk and a constant clicking of the heels and nodding and a cute little German accent and Marilyn Monroe playing a bimbo so much better than anybody can these days. You'd think Britney Spears would learn something by looking at her. It's an early performance. She was quite good. James Whitmore is very funny, very odd, plays a hunchback. This movie really holds up mostly as I keep saying because of all these wonderful performances by these great actors. John Huston directed it and it's extremely well put together. It's very tight. It's very well shot. It moves along. It's not as gritty and dark as other film noir's of the time and it's maybe a little bit too slick for its own good but I've seen it over and over again over the years and it never lets me down. It never lets me down. I always love to see it. I made a tape of it off of the Z Channel in LA way back in the early 80s and I watched it until the tape wore out."

gNled6wh18c,3371,Bound for Glory (1976)," The man who wrote those words was Woody Guthrie. His music has become as much a part of America as its mountains, its rivers, its forests, and its people. His life has touched all of our lives. This is his story. He was born in 1912 in Okeema, Oklahoma. He was raised in the grit of the dust bowl and the poverty of the Depression. He was a husband, a father, a lover, a fighter, a sign painter, a songwriter, and a wanderer. He traveled America on its rails. I could shoot you in the hand if I wanted. I could take you out in them weeds after everybody's gone. Across its prairies and down its open roads, wherever he went, he made music. Stick out your little hand to every woman and kid, man. And he made friends. How did you? He saw what was right with this country and what was wrong. What the hell's going on here? All these people are living like this. Don't you get just a little bit embarrassed about having so much when so many people have got nothing. I'd like to dedicate a song tonight to all you folks sitting out there in them fruit-picking camps. I know you're squatting there hungry, either too darn hot or too darn cold. You continually force me to treat you like a child. Now what do I have to say to get through to you? You can tell me you don't like my singing. I'm trying to tell you something. They're our sponsors. They pay for the right to hear what they want to hear. You don't think nothing about running off whenever you get the urge. Don't even talk like that. I truly care about you and the kids. Well, that sure ain't the way it seems you're spending your whole life out there trying to fix the world. It's a mighty hard road that these poor hands have hoed. He touched the people. Green pastures of pain from high desert ground. He felt their spirit. Now one, two, three. Yo-yo! All your times scare me. I'm singing to you. He fought for their dream. To land in your land.

Yes, and a whole new world of entertainment wonders is gloriously unfurled in the Crimson story of the Crimson Pirate. In the turbulent days when the lush islands of the Caribbean lay crushed in the steel grip of the cruel Baron Gruda. When only one of the most powerful pirates in the world was ever seen in the world. And the world was never seen in the world. And the world was never seen in the world. And the world was never seen in the world. And in the cruel baron Gruda, when only one man, the Crimson Pirate, dared to oppose the tyrant's might. Captain Valo, Valo the Vagrant, as daring in love as he was in battle, who preyed upon the golden galleons of the oppressor, and stormed his citadels with cutlass and sabre, stout heart, and bare fists. And when mutiny left him to face the enemy alone, he forged the weapons of an unborn age to blast the threat of tyranny from the sea. Hands aloft, please. You're the prisoners of Captain Valo and his scurvy crew. You may be overconfident, Captain Valo. There are 200 of the King's Marines aboard this vessel. And only 20 pirates.

rAQSa0963T8,3424,Do the Right Thing (1989)," It's a tale of good and evil. Hey! It was with this hand that Cain iced his rug. Love. These five fingers, they go straight to the soul of man. The right hand, the hand of love. The story of life is this. Static. Once again we find ourselves in the middle of a national conversation about race. A conversation that's been going on for much longer than we've even been a nation. And Hollywood has sometimes tried to participate in this conversation for a long time through well-meaning lesson teaching movies. Movie! But it really took a young African-American filmmaker in the hip-hop era to make a movie that got all of the noise and cacophony and confusion of that conversation and put it into a powerful and entertaining form. I'm talking about Do the Right Thing, Spike Lee's third feature film, which came out in 1989. Hey, I got it like that. Do the Right Thing takes on issues of enormous national imports, but it takes place on a wonderfully small scale. It's basically a single block in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn on a single day, the hottest day of the summer. Cinematography by Ernest Dickerson has this wonderful orangey-red quality to it. The music by Spike Lee's father, Bill, kind of casts a sort of warm, sticky glow over the whole thing. And the cast is just wonderful. You have all of these neighborhood characters who come on screen sometimes just for a few seconds and give it such bursts of life and energy and humor. There's Martin Lawrence. There's Samuel L. Jackson. Bill Nunn. Rosie Perez in her first movie. Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. Richard Edson. John Turturro. Danny Aiello. And of course, Spike Lee himself. I gotta go. I'm working. I'm working. I'm working. This is the mayor talking. All right. All right. Doctor. Come on. What? What? Always do the right thing. That's it? That's it. I got it. I'm gone. Most of the movie is arguments and anecdotes and little scenes of life on this street on this day. I'm sick of this. It's like I come to work. It's the Planet of the Apes. There's a lot of anger and tension and resentment seething under the surface of ordinary life. And at the end of this day, it explodes. When Do the Right Thing came out in 1989, a fairly momentous year on the world stage, it was a hugely controversial movie. People were afraid that it was going to spark riots in cities and it was the subject of a lot of op-eds and editorials. And at the time, a lot of people accused Spike Lee of being a provocateur. But you have to say, given the context in which the movie was released, he doesn't seem to have been exaggerating very much. There were still to come the Crown Heights riots and the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. People, please disperse. Please disperse. Since this movie came out, a lot has obviously changed. And I think we can say that things have improved, but I don't think we can say that things have gotten any simpler. Race is still the American dilemma. It's still one of the most confusing and also one of the most fascinating subjects in our national life. We spend a lot of time wondering what the right thing is, what we should do. And I don't think there's any movie that has captured that contradiction, that complexity, quite as well as Do the Right Thing. And for that reason, it's just one of the great American films. No! No! No! Oh, no!"

hEQCHkg8U3I,3445,Eyes of Laura Mars (1978)," Hi, this is David D'Coto and I'm at the Trailers from Hell Studios in Hollywood, California. Faye Dunaway has had a very, very, very interesting career. She would go from movies to television, all over the place. But in the late 70s, she did one of my favorite Faye Dunaway movies. And no, it wasn't Mommy Dearest. It's the eyes of Laura Mars. Oh, I love this movie. I must have seen Eyes of Laura Mars a dozen times during its original theatrical release in 1978. The beautiful Faye Dunaway plays Laura Mars, a successful fashion photographer who is cursed with the ability to see through the eyes of a serial killer. Halloween's John Carpenter writes a suspense thriller called Eyes. His dark star distributor, Jack H. Harris, also the producer of the blob, options the script. Could be a good low budget shocker. Enter mega producer and former hairdresser, John Peters. What was supposed to be an indie genre movie becomes a major studio movie starring Faye Dunaway and a young Tommy Lee Jones, a young Brad Dorif and a young Raul Julia. Eyes of Laura Mars is a scary, sexy, delicious thriller that proves that director Irvin Kershner could work in any genre. He went on to direct Empire Strikes Back right after this. I had no idea that the director of the Flim Flam Man had a movie like this in him. When it happens, I can't see what's in front of me. Producer John Peters had his then girlfriend, Barbara Streisand, sing the theme song. Editor Michael Kahn went on to edit most of Steven Spielberg's movies. One of the true stars of the movie, though, is music composer Artie Kane. Known for many 70s and 80s TV show themes, he delivers a gripping and in-your-face score that is very memorable. I'm surprised he hasn't done more thrillers. The Michael Zager Band supplies the disco hit Let's All Chant. Later, he composed the Friday the 13th Part 3 disco theme along with Harry Mantrodini. Faye Dunaway is so amazing and electrifying in Eyes of Laura Mars, I am surprised she didn't get nominated for an award. Her performance fires on all cylinders and she is so intense you can't take your eyes off of her. I can't think of anybody else playing this role. What is going on? I don't know. I mean, it's completely unprofessional of me to be walking with you in the woods, I'll tell you that. It all wraps up with a surprising and satisfying twist ending that I didn't see coming.

Fxp32VHaYdE,3471,Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)," Close encounters of the first kind, sighting of an unidentified flying object. Close encounters of the second kind, physical evidence of a UFO. Close encounters of the third kind, actual contact. Columbia Pictures in association with EMI presents Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The director is Steven Spielberg, whose most recent motion picture, Jaws, is already a legend. The producers are Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips of The Sting and Taxi Driver. Creating special effects is Douglas Trumley, who in this film goes far beyond his achievements in 2001, Space Odyssey. For the music, there was only one choice, 11-time Academy Award nominee John Williams, composer of the scores for Jaws and Star Wars. The technical advisor is the world's foremost authority on unidentified flying objects, Dr. J. Allen Heineck of Northwestern University. Heading the cast is Richard Dreyfus, who has shown his rare talent in such diverse films as American Graffiti, The Apprenticeship of Judy Kravitz, and Jaws. And making his American debut as an actor is the great French director, François Truffaut, winner of the 1974 Academy Award. A close encounter would happen to anyone. It could happen to you. It does happen to Roy Neary. An average working man, Neary finds his life, his very world, changed. We have very little time, Mr. Neary. We need answers from you. They're honest, direct, and to the point. Who are you people? Have you recently had a close encounter? I want to speak to someone in charge. Une rencontre plutôt inhabituelle. I want to lodge a complaint. A close encounter with something very unusual. What the hell is going on around here? Who the hell are you people? The title of the picture, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, refers to an intriguing possibility. A close encounter of the first kind is one is close, but nothing really happens. A close encounter of the first kind is visible contact with UFO. Forget the shape and forget how fast it's going. It's something that you just can't explain. Close encounters of the second kind are those which leave a physical trace. Holes in the ground, fern rings, broken tree branches, telephone lines down, animals disturbed, the stopping of car engines. And the close encounters of the third kind are the most interesting of all. Close encounter of the third kind is really when you meet them. Close encounters of the third kind. The experience of an ordinary man, shared by people from all over the world, irresistibly drawn by a compulsion they don't understand. To witness the most dramatic event in the history of the human race. And what you will see has never been seen before. It begins in an Indiana town and leads to one innocent man. He is a man who has been murdered in the last few years. He is a man who has been murdered in the last few years. It begins in an Indiana town and leads to one inescapable conclusion."
N8fhqHyRj6M,3473,Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 (Jonas qui aura 25 ans en l'an 2000) (1976)," Je vous présente votre nouveau professeur d'histoire, M. Marco Perlis. Il remplace M. Gento qui, comme vous le savez, vient de prendre sa retraite. Je compte sur vous pour lui réserver un bon accueil. Vous n'oubliez jamais que mon père est boucher. Et que ma mère chante très bien l'opérette. Est-ce que quelqu'un veut venir couper le bouddha en dur avec le métronome ? Ça va pour le moment. C'est des morceaux d'histoire. Comment va-t-on les appeler ? Des heures, des décades, des siècles. C'est la même chose et ça ne s'arrête jamais. Le boudin se mange avec de la purée de pommes. Est-ce que le temps est du boudin ? Darwin le croyait. Quoique la nature de la viande changeait d'un bout à l'autre de la saucisse. Marx, celui pensait qu'un jour tout le monde s'arrêterait de manger du boudin. Einstein et Max Planck arrachèrent la peau du boudin qui perdait alors sa forme. De quoi la peau du boudin est-elle faite ? C'est de l'intestin de cochon. Très bien. Regardons maintenant le boudin qui n'est pas encore coupé. On y voit des plis, des méandres. Et c'est de cela que je veux vous parler. De quoi sont fait les plis du temps ? Dans les sociétés agricoles, les hommes croyaient que le temps consistait simplement en cycle, en saison. Chaque solstice d'hiver contenait le même moment. L'individu devenait vieux, bien entendu, mais c'était simplement parce qu'il s'usait. Il était le combustible qui faisait marcher la machine des saisons. Le capitalisme apportera à l'idée du temps autoroute. Autoroute du soleil, autoroute du progrès. L'idée du progrès, c'était que les conquérants n'avaient pas simplement gagné une bataille, mais qu'ils avaient été choisis et désignés en tant qu'êtres intrinsèquement supérieurs. Leur supériorité devait forcément traverser les cycles et les saisons. Elle les transforma en tire-bouchons, dont eux, les conquérants, étaient la pointe. Et avec cette pointe, ils ouvrirent les unes après les autres les bouteilles des cultures inférieures. Ils burent jusqu'à étancher leur soif et jetèrent les bouteilles en s'assurant bien qu'elles se cassent. Ceci était une nouvelle forme de violence. La flèche ou l'épée avaient déjà tué, mais ce qui tuait maintenant, c'était le verdict de l'histoire. De l'histoire des conquérants, bien sûr. Avec cette nouvelle violence, arriva une peur nouvelle chez les conquérants. La peur du passé. La peur des inférieurs dans leurs bouteilles cassées. Ah ! Si le passé pouvait un jour rattraper les conquérants, il montrerait certainement aussi peu de pitié qu'il n'en avait montré eux. Au XIXe siècle, cette peur du passé fut rationnellement transformée en loi scientifique. Le temps devint alors une route sans virage. La longueur de la route était une abstraction terrifiante, seulement les abstractions ne se vangent pas. Dès lors, les penseurs du XIXe siècle choisirent la peur de la pensée en éliminant la peur du sauvage et de ses flèches. Et leur route avait des bornes absolument régulières, des millions d'années, divisées en heures, en dates, en jours et en heures de travail, appointées sur la machine à pointer, comme du bouddha. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très simple, mais qui est très difficile à traverser. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très difficile à traverser. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très difficile à traverser. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très difficile à traverser. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très difficile à traverser. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très difficile à traverser. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très difficile à traverser. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très difficile à traverser. La courbure de la route est une route qui est très difficile à traverser. Aujourd'hui, enfin, on voit que l'autoroute du capitalisme s'effondre. Pour plus de raison que je ne peux vous en dire dans le petit bout de bouddha qu'est cette leçon inaugurale. Dans un gland, il y a déjà les méandres qui donneront la forme du chêne. Ce que vous êtes, chacun de vous, était déjà là dans les chromosomes au moment de ma conception. Non, je vous demande pardon de votre conception. Je ne suis pas un déterministe, mais dans votre première cellule, il y avait un message que vous êtes maintenant en train de lire. Il y a des choses qui font des trous dans le temps. Et les trous s'alignent parfaitement, on peut y faire passer une brochette. N'oubliez pas que mon père est boucher. La brochette. Le temps se plie pour que les trous coïncident. Et pourquoi n'étons jamais prophète en son propre pays ? Parce que les prophètes n'arrivent qu'à la moitié des trous. Comme ça. Ils sont entre les temps. Personne ne compris grand-chose à Diderot, jusqu'au moment où une génération entière crie à monstres, à Freud. C'est l'instant là pour passer au travers du trou. Les trous que font les prophètes pour regarder le futur sont les mêmes par lesquels les historiens lorgnent ensuite vers les vieux meubles du passé. Regardez-les, lorgniés à travers les trous creusés par Jean-Jacques Rousseau pour nous expliquer le XVIIIe siècle. Regardez vos montres. Bon, c'est l'heure. On va terminer avec le rythme binaire, celui du cœur et des batteurs. Entre chaque coup, il y a du temps. Le temps, c'est le fait de reconnaître que le deuxième coup n'est pas le premier. Le temps est créé par l'opposition. Le temps, c'est le fait de reconnaître que le deuxième coup n'est pas le premier. Le temps, c'est le fait de reconnaître que le deuxième coup n'est pas le premier. En synthèse, le temps se réduit. L'embryo humain siffle au travers de l'évolution. Dans une synthèse totale, le temps disparaît. Dans une synthèse totale, le temps disparaît."

Will we see each other again like this? It's up to you. You've got to be careful. One love grew in the shadows of the night, sealed by a secret they could share with no one. The other love flamed in the bright light of gaiety and laughter, a need that drove him with all the recklessness of youth itself, a dream that was built on deception.

And five, she does this thing in bed when she can't get to sleep. She kind of half-moans and then rubs her feet together an equal number of times. It just kills me.

VF6SxjLBfHk,3523,Taffin (1988)," This month, MGMUA home video delivers one of the hottest leading men of the 80s in a provocative new action thriller. Pierce Brosnan is Taffin. He's a hero. A lover. A victim. A killer. And the man who stands between heaven and hell, good and evil. Adapted from Lyndon Mallet's widely read Taffin novels, Mark Taffin keeps the peace. In a small Irish town, he calls home with his own friend of justice. He's the one the locals call when they want to even the score. I believe I mentioned this some. All right, all right. But now, a bigger menace has taken root. I'm trying to organize a committee to fight the building of that industrial monstrosity. Look, I've done my best. These are vicious. Greedy, corrupt men were dealing with. Pray for them. A menace powered by greed. When little people are on the take, they need to feel respected. If the greed isn't stopped, it will destroy everything in its path. Union man, are you? We don't need unions, Mr. Ruffles. We take care of our own problems. The town turns desperately to the one man who can help. We need everyone we can get on our side. I can't sense the world that we live in. Is Taffin willing to take the challenge? My help has consequences. I'm only your weapon. For Pierce Brosnan, the star of Noble House. That's a mortar over there? Yeah, I thought so. The role of Mark Taffin is unlike any other he has portrayed. Brosnan is riveting as the hired enforcer, a complex character who by equal turns is both good and evil. If you give someone the choice and make him believe it, that he can either pay his debts or lose a finger, he'll make the rational decision. Taffin struggles with the violence that surrounds him. This is far more powerful than this. You're that bastard Taffin's brother. So what if we are? No, he's not, is he? The very violence by which he leads his life. This time I'm not dealing with rational people. They're psychopaths. He knows that sometimes the only way to win is to fight. You are dead. Not today, I don't think. This is one enemy he's prepared to face. I think you need to change the scenery. Not until I'm finished here. No, you're finished here. But when Taffin is framed for a murder he didn't commit. I got no proof. Not a thing. Well, I'm damn sure I did it. It turns into an all out war. I want you to clear my name. Now why should I do that? Because I'll kill you if you don't. You're a fool. Pierce Brosnan is Taffin."

KPN9veJHw94,3531,All the Vermeers in New York (1990)," The reputation of me is a painter. That's all I want to do is move a painting. One painting. Not even two paintings. One painting. It's not ridiculous. Ten thousand dollars. I mean, my next three or four paintings will work double that. Maybe even triple. All of Vermeer's in New York is the title of a film that deals in an unusual way with the relationship between the observer and the work of art. John Jast is a 50 year old American who's considered the master of the low budget movie and his film is winning him a growing number of fans. He's been defined anarchic, anti-Hollywood and the guru of American independent filmmaking. He's almost completed a film set in Rome and it's to him that this portrait of art and the cinema is dedicated. For me, film is a mix of all these things. I'm very interested in painting and photography and I use visual arts as a constant reference and a research realm. As I go study paintings, I go spend a lot of time in museums and the visual aspect is as important to me as, say, the narrative story or what I think of as the music of film, which I'm not talking about the music you write for it, but the total, the totality of a film for me should be a piece of music. There are more Vermeer's in New York than there are anywhere else in the world. There's a reason for it and that is that at the time Vermeer, who was not a well-known painter in his own time, the time he became known or sort of discovered several hundred years later, America was the most powerful empire and of course we went in. Also Vermeer lived in the time that the city of New Amsterdam was seized by the British and changed its name into New York. Museums are strange places because they're basically like an acrology or it's full of dead things. Museums are full of dead things. Real good dead things stay alive though. I mean most, if you go to the Metropolitan Museum, which is a great, one of the best museums in the world probably, 90% of what is on the walls is junk. A long time ago I could never look at old art. I could only look at contemporary art. Now I can barely stand to look at contemporary art and especially I nearly hate the art of the 50s and 60s and 70s from America. I find it shallow and empty. A piece of work, the admiration aroused by which will matter little to his body devoured by worms. Like the patch of yellow wall painted with so much knowledge and skill by an artist who must forever remain unknown and is barely identified under the name Vermeer."

In fact, I can't find anything to criticize about this movie. I love this It's really good. It's very sobering Because it deals with the Nazis in a very unblinking way. I Recommend this wholeheartedly. This is a truly great film Liza deserved every accolade she got come Here the music Play Life is a cabaret old chum Come to the cabaret This trailer Must have been made during production probably a foreign sales trailer because there's no Walla and the mix is weird and there's a couple of making of shots You can tell this is a foreign sales trailer by these credits an American trailer would never list all the creatives like this They throw them up on one card and get rid of them quick I love a cabaret"

ykzP_64l-xk,3549,Guys and Dolls (1955)," Ladies and gentlemen, I think you've all heard about the man who actually paid a million dollars for a movie story. His name, of course, Samuel Goldman, and the story he bought was Guys and Dolls. Now, because I felt that this was the greatest musical I'd ever seen, I actually made four flying trips to the Pacific coast to film excerpts of the show for my Sunday night TVer over the CBS network. And it is my idea of a wonderful picture. Now, incidentally, that million dollar check that Sam wrote was only a starter. Before he was through, Guys and Dolls had cost him five and a half million dollars. And in Runyon's language, that is a lot of lettuce. Now, what does Sam Goldman get for it? Well, among other things, he got Damon Runyon's world of fabulous characters. The jails must be empty tonight. Can anybody be missing? Terry the horse, Liverlips Louie, Angie the Ox, Society Max. And here is a face for which I cannot supply a name. May I ask where you come from? East Cicero, Illinois. And what is your occupation there? I'm a scout master. Marlon Brando never danced or sang a note in his life until he met Gold. But he sings and he dances in Guys and Dolls and he'll fracture you. Gene Simmons, too, is a dramatic star, not a singer. But as Sister Sarah of the Mission Doll, she's adorable and her singing voice is terrific. Together, these two generate excitement that's electric. Let me show you what I mean. Would you be open to a proposition? I've had those, no. Don't flatter yourself. I'm talking business. I am in a position to supply you with the raw material you need for your work, namely Simmons. How? Frank Sinatra has amazed the entertainment world with his dramatic prowess. Now to prove he's still the top song interpreter, here he is as Nathan Detroit. Adelaide is taking a chance on me You're at it again, you're running the game, I'm not gonna play second fiddle to that I'm sick and I'm tired of stalling around, I'm telling you now that we're through When I think of the time, but I'm... Adelaide, Adelaide! ...not thinking the way I try Adelaide! I could honestly... Vivian Blaine was a comedy sensation in the original cast. She's even funnier in the picture. With four great stars like these, Goldwyn needed a writer and a director just as big. He found both these talents in four-time Academy Award winner Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The result is sheer greatness. One short scene will show you what Joe Mankiewicz can do with a few simple words. Whatever you do, wherever you go. Why, Sister Sarah? Why, Sister Sarah, why? I want to be with you. The world's full of souls closer to salvation than mine. Anytime, anywhere. Easier to save and much more worth saving. You and me. The music of Frank Lesser is always a part of the story. Michael Kidd's imaginative dance direction even tops the exciting job he did in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Now he has the Goldwyn girls to work with. Of all the grand entertainment ever produced by Samuel Goldwyn, an Academy Award winner himself, this is his best. With its humor and drama, its songs, its beauty, no musical ever made can compare to Guys and Dolls. And with stars like Marlon Brando, Gene Simmons, Frank Sinatra, Vivian Blaine, and a cast of hundreds in CinemaScope and Color, the toast to the town predicts that Guys and Dolls will be the toast to the world."

pMdkg4qDISs,3603,"Gay Deceivers, The (1969)"," Hi, I'm David D'Coto and I'm at the trailers from Hill Studios. Gaysploitation movies wasn't exactly the successful subgenre as black exploitations were. Crown International tried it with the Pink Angels and Joe Solomon's fanfare tried it with The Gay Deceivers. The Gay Deceivers just came out on DVD and I tell you, I had to put it in my permanent collection. Not that I liked the film very much, it's just kind of a train wreck happening right before your eyes. It kind of looks like a Love American style episode. It has the same sort of production design. But Michael Greer, the actor right here, as the gay landlord, kind of makes the whole movie worthwhile. He's very, very funny. Star Kevin Coughlin unfortunately died in a sort of tragic way. He was hit by a car and left Hollywood. Very odd, very odd little movie. But it's fun to watch because there's nothing really out there like it. Brooke Bundy's in the picture, probably one of the busiest actors of the time that she is there. She went on to star in a couple of Nightmare on Elm Street movies. She is also an agent. I worked with her once and she works as an agent now too. But it's a very weird movie because it doesn't really know what its target audience is. Jack Sterrett, who was a character actor and went on to direct such films as Race with the Devil, is in this movie as sort of a, we think, a homophobic drill sergeant. But we find out that he's not much later on in the movie. Comedy actor Michael Greer makes this whole film worthwhile. There's a great scene where a woman walks out of an apartment building and accidentally steps into a flower patch. And Michael Greer's alarm says, you're stepping on my daffodils. And she looks down and says, those aren't daffodils, they're peonies. And he says to her, oh, I may not know my flowers, but I know a bitch when I see one. The Gay Deceivers is a tough set, but check it out. You won't see anything like it."

gP1xMPDGsPQ,3605,King Creole (1958)," Hi, I'm Don Coscarelli and welcome to Trailers from Hell. Today we're going to watch a trailer for a movie with the king of rock and roll, Elvis Presley. You know, Elvis took a lot of criticism, a lot of heat for some of his movies, but today we're going to watch a trailer to a movie that was one of his best. You know he's gone, gone, gone, jumping like a catfish on a pole. The movie is King Creel and this could be Elvis' best movie. Acting for one of the finest directors he ever worked with, the director of Casablanca, the fabulous Michael Curtiz. Filmed shot in beautiful black and white down on actual atmospheric locations in New Orleans. Only Elvis could get him to close down Bourbon Street to film this movie. King Creel is probably Elvis' greatest supporting cast. Club owner Paul Stewart, the sleazy mobster Walter Mathau, and none other than the lovely Morticia Adams, the great Carolyn Jones, as the call girl that Elvis had his thang for. The film also stars Vic Morrow in his tough guy mode, and the Academy Award winning Dean Jagger as Elvis' father. King Creel has some great songs, but a fair share of bad and mediocre ones too. Legend tells it that Elvis' manager, Colonel Tom Parker, had this annoying habit of jamming as many songs as he could into his Elvis movies so he could get bigger soundtracks and sell more records. Now Elvis said that the favorite movie he ever did was Clambake, but the critics vote for this one. Elvis turns in a terrific acting performance as the troubled youth Danny Fisher, who tries to make her break from the grinding poverty he comes from and reach for his true potential. This just may be Elvis' best and most nuanced performance, well that is until recently, when just a few years back those filmmakers found Elvis in a rest home down in East Texas and starred him in that independent horror movie, Baba Hotep. Cool bit of trivia is that during production Elvis was drafted into the Army, but the good old Colonel was able to get Elvis a deferment so he could finish up the movie before shipping out to Germany. King Creel is Elvis at his very best, looking great, singing the songs, slaying the gals and just doing his two-fisted best to take down the bad guys. After the movie was released, the King Creel soundtrack album went all the way to number two on the billboard chart, so obviously Colonel Parker knew what he was doing. King Creel is a movie fit for the king, with a great cast and a great director. Check it out, and thank you for listening. Thank you very much. www.youtube.com"

w81n8BUWixM,3627,Carnival of Souls (1962)," Hi, I'm Mary Lambert. This is Trailers from Hell. Today's trailer is The Carnival of Solve, a black and white independent film that was shot in Lawrenceville, Kansas, and the director is actually the zombie who chases the poor heroine around the movie. Here it is. Hey, you want to drive, huh? Drive it up. A lot of my favorite horror fantasy movies have the theme of the parallel universe, or the lost in the midst of time story, and that's the basis of this story, the parallel universe. And also, the character in the movie is named Mary, which is my name too, so naturally I identified with her right off the bat. Candace Hillegos, who plays Mary in this movie, she does it with kind of a weird, wooden kind of acting, but it really fits the theme, which is basically that she died in a car accident at the beginning of the movie and she's dead. So in this case, I don't know if she went on to do other movies where she was dead, but that's what she's good at for sure. I really like the strange creepiness of rural America. It resonates for me because that's where I grew up. And there was also a pipe organ at the church I attended as a child, so the scenes where she's the...I really like the scenes where she's sort of the omnipotent, invisible soundtrack. I think those scenes are really powerful in a subliminal way. And this one guy that's all through the trailer is this zombie that's like sort of haunting her and bringing her to her, you know, her inevitable resting place, or I mean her fate is that she has to join the zombies. And basically the story of the movie is her accepting her fate. I guess when she drowned the first time, she wasn't ready to accept her fate. And the movie is this zombie sort of pursuing her as she tries desperately to connect with other human beings, but without any success at all. And finally she's driven from the church. I don't know why she has to be a zombie, but... It's her fate. The whole zombie lore, you can change it any way you want. Zombies come after you for no good reason. Zombies basically, if you're alive and they're not, they're going to come after you."

I was attracted to someone. I was attracted to someone. I was attracted to someone. I suppose women are capable of something more. You don't like women, do you? On the contrary, I love women, but I don't admire them. Why? Women? Out of the earth, realistic, dominated by physical facts. What nonsense. Once a woman betrays a man, she despises him. In spite of his goodness and position, she will give him up to someone inferior. That someone is more, shall we say, attractive. How do you know that? Attractive. How little you know about women. You'd be surprised. That isn't love. What is love? Giving, sacrificing. The same thing a mother feels for her child. Did you love that way? Yes. Whom? My husband. You're married? I was. He died while I was in jail. I see. Tell me about him. That's a long story. He was wounded in the war, a hopeless invalid. An invalid? That's why I loved him. He needed me, depended on me. He was like a child. But he was more than a child to me. He was a religion. My very breath. I'd have killed for him. No. Love is something very real and deep. I know that. However... Pardon me. I believe there's a little cork in that wine. Let me get you another glass. I'll be right back. Any bad thoughts? No. I have to be honest. I don't know. I understand. I don't know. I know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know."

EsMuK_Sos58,3634,Seven Days in May (1964)," I'm suggesting, Mr. President, there's a military plot to take over the government. This may occur sometime this coming Sunday. There are some who will say it can never happen here. But this is the story of how it could happen. In seven days of intrigue, of blackmail, of terror, and eternity of suspense, this is the astounding story of a military plot to overthrow the government of the United States, which, if successful, would change the fate of every American. You're a nightcrawler, Colonel, a peddler. You sell information. Are you sufficiently up on your Bible to know who Judas was? Yes, I know who Judas was. He was a man I worked for and admired until he disgraced the four stars on his uniform. Seven days in May, the first day, when the Marauders were in the country, the first day, the second day, seven days in May, the first day, the second day, the third day when unknown men prepared to kidnap the president from his private visit to New York research The fifth day that brought a secret presidential messenger to death in a plane crash in Spain. The day a senator of the United States was held against his will. The fifth day when a woman found her past being used for blackmail. Look, Ellie, if I could tell you why I had to do this, you'd understand. I'll tell you something. I was a stupid, impressionable female who let an Air Force general use her like his personal airplane. The sixth day, the discovery of a desert base for an airborne task force, kept secret even from the President of the United States. The seventh day, when the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff dared the President of the United States to stop the conspiracy that couldn't be proved. You're not a weak sister, Mr. President. You're a criminally weak sister. You say I've duped the people, General. I've built them, I've misled them, I've stripped them naked and made them defenseless. You accuse me of having lost their faith, deliberately and criminally, shut my ears to the national voice. I do. Well, where the hell have you heard that voice, General, in freight elevators, in dark alleys, in secret places in the dead of night? How did that voice seep into a locked room full of conspirators? That's not why you hear the voice of the people, General, not in this Republic. And I will not resign voluntarily. I'm going to fight you. And then we'll see which one of us the United States is willing to follow. The End"

VKayG1TrfuE,3671,Blazing Saddles (1974)," Torn from the fiery pages of the mightiest annals of the West, comes the Supreme Saga, in the great tradition of frontier drama. Schwarzes!

mYpRaGbKjbc,3672,Benji (1974)," His theme song is I Feel Love. It's won a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination. Critics across the country are saying he should win an Academy Award himself for his outstanding acting performance in his first full-length motion picture. And audiences everywhere are calling him America's new most huggable hero. I feel love all around. I can feel it shining down. Benji, a delightfully different motion picture starring Peter Brecht, Christopher Conley, Patsy Garrett, Tom Lester, Mark Slade, Deborah Walley, and Herb Vigran, with special guest appearances by Francis Pavier, Edgar Buchanan, Terry Carter, and introducing Cynthia Smith, Alan Fusette, and the face critics are saying is more expressive than many actors in a picture of love and suspense from a dog's point of view. It wasn't just like a typical Walt Disney dog movie. It was really a brilliant movie. When you think of a dog, a dog show, you think, oh, kids, but I enjoyed it, my parents enjoyed it, and everybody that went there enjoyed it. I didn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. That's an incredible movie. It's a very good movie. Dog movie? Oh, no. It's not a dog movie. That dog has emotions. That dog is fantastic. To tell you the truth, I went with the intention that I wasn't going to enjoy it since it was a kids movie, and I really did enjoy it, and I came out of there, and I really felt touched. It was a heartwarming movie. No, in fact, if my husband comes, I know he'll cry through the whole thing. I did. I think this movie is a mixture of drama, excitement. Oh, no, but it's not a dog picture. It's just got so much life. I think it was great. It really was. It was just super. It's a pretty film. The scenery is pretty. The photography is, the photography was just overwhelming. It's kind of a love story. I'd see it every day. I'd never get sick of it. Nobody would. It's for the kids. It's for the adults and the grandparents. I mean, it's for everybody. And the dog was a neat dog. When I left the movie, I felt that I knew that dog. This is the ransom note. There weren't any fingerprints, and we haven't heard anything from handwriting yet. How was it delivered? Well, doctor, would you mind going over it one more time, please? Yes, I got a call at my office, supposedly from Cindy's school, that she had been in some sort of accident. They asked me if I could come right over to the nurse's office. When I went to the parking lot to get in my car, I found this, a pen to the visor. I see. And have they called yet? No. Has there been any attempt to get a hold of you at all since you got to know her? No, we've had a little bit of trouble getting to know her. No, no, no! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Got you. Liz Smith of Cosmopolitan says, everybody who's ever been loved by a dog will adore Benji. Ver 너! Say, you're the included character from Wicked Cousin. ?! You're so huge! itself to every audience fortunate enough to catch it and it should be caught. The Baltimore News American says it sounds rash to say but this dog can act. The Dallas Morning News says there is no Oscar for animal actors but perhaps they should create a special one for this remarkable performer. Family Circle says thank goodness the kind of movie that adults as well as kids will find utterly charming and entertaining. The St. Petersburg Independent says I cannot think of anyone of any age who would not be entertained by this film. The National Observer says Benji is obviously the most accomplished canine actor in America. The Richmond Times Dispatch says Joe Camp has brought to the screen what all America has been waiting for. Benji, the most talked about highly acclaimed family picture of our time. Maybe of all time. A family film by Joe Camp. From Mulberry Square."

For security reasons, someone decided to let him carry the coordinate code for the secret meeting with the scientist. What's so important about the scientist? I think he's close to a formula that'll turn one barrel of oil into ten or twelve. And you can guess how many folks would like to get their hands on that. The whole thing sounds like a James Bond movie. Yeah, except in a movie I'd be Robert Redford. And you'd be Jean-Vier Boujong. Anyway, it was a very simple and very clever plan. Except the man we thought was Dietrich found out about it, eliminated the real Dietrich, and took his place. He was going to sell the scientist to the highest bidder. Would have worked, too, if Banji hadn't missed that plane change in Athens. Hey, you're not living up to your part of the bargain. If I'm going to talk, you've got to pull. So talk. This person you thought was Dietrich, how did he find out about all this? Oh, I don't know. Security leaves somewhere, I guess. Happens all the time. By the way, how's Banji? Any signs of wear and tear? I don't think Banji's ever been better.

UelBmskBuXk,3678,"Man with the Golden Arm, The (1955)"," Hi, I'm Kat Shea and this is Trailers from Hell. I'm doing the trailer for The Man with the Golden Arm, which was directed by Otto Preminger. Otto Preminger is known for making really unusual trailers, essentially starring himself. This is a great way to market yourself as a director and I think we can all learn from his example. You make a really controversial film and then you star yourself defending it. Okay, I shouldn't be laughing about that. I've sort of done it. Preminger made an incredibly ballsy movie here. A 1950s audience might even consider it subversive, but it starred Frank Sinatra, who wanted an Academy Award, and Kim Novak, so it wasn't going to fail even though it's essentially about a guy jonesing. This looks like a scene from the movie, but it actually isn't. It's just kind of a trick really to get us to the sound stage. They tell me you was working here and I was passing by, I thought I'd have a drink. Oh, I've been here a while. You're doing any good? All right. Smoke cut in the drink, you shall cut him again. Ain't got all night, Jackie. Right. Have some. Right. Two doubles. You don't have to do that, Frankie. No reason you should lose money by wasting time talking to me. Don't say that, you know it ain't a waste. I've been hoping you'd come see me. You know how it is, Marley. Sure. Sure, busy you know. Well, here's to it, Marley-O. Marley-O. I ain't heard that since you went away. Cut, sprint, very good. Come let me down. Say if you like to take. Otto Preminger was often pushing the boundaries of censorship, so for the trailer he has a Mr. Pearson who may or may not be the real studio's head. He could be an actor playing the part. Come down to the set to meet the actors and express his concerns to the greatly respected Otto Preminger. Now, Otto tells us the movie can't be censored because this is a free country. It's sort of funny in his heavy Austro-Hungarian accent, which sounds German, evidenced by the fact that he played Nazis in at least a couple of movies. There's a discussion of Washington coming down on both the studio head and the director and why he thinks that even children should watch this film. It's interesting that this took place in 1955. I've seen and been in on discussions like this on CNN in fairly recent times. I always wondered when one might use the saying, the more things change, the more they stay the same. I guess that would be now. The Man with the Golden Arm was significant to me because although it was made before I was born, its influence is long felt, certainly into my beginnings as a filmmaker. Frank Sinatra played Frankie Machine, who was a guy struggling to make a good life for himself, but he's ultimately a heroin addict. Prior to this movie, all addicts were depicted as crazed drug fiends who had no humanity. I remember as a kid watching movies where you didn't understand it at all. Drug addicts were depicted in a way that stripped the characters of all personality, all humanity and humor. Even as a child, you watched it and knew something was wrong. Something was not truthful in the depiction. The thinking was, of course, that if you made a drug addict, someone who had redeeming qualities and lots of kids would feel fine about becoming drug addicts. It's the thinking behind Reefer Madness. It's very well-meaning, but we all know it doesn't work. It makes it really hard to make good movies. This movie has a great poster by Saul Bass. It's of an addict's arm and it's just really bold and very cool poster. It had to be a big deal for Otto Preminger to bring this story and this character to the screen. There was the threat of censorship from Washington for this film, and Preminger accuses the censors in this trailer of only thinking about power, prejudice and suspicion. He suggests that the film be labeled for its content so that if parents don't want their children to see it, they can make the decision. Perhaps this was the beginning of the rating system. characters that at first you'd think you'd never like and yet you love them on some level by the end. I always love characters that have a lot of gray areas, and for me this was the beginning. This is where it started. I predict that it'll do a real service for humanity. Thank you very much. You forgive me, Mr. Pearson. Ludwig, we go here because we've got a half hour to finish the picture. Yeah? We go? Come. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Anatole. Schnell. I think we should start. You be the judge. Do I really have an accent as ugly as he makes it out? Very romantic accent. He was passionate about making the movie and passionate about defending it. It was inspiring to me."
XsS3GLw2-DA,3681,For a Few Dollars More (Per qualche dollaro in più) (1965)," You remember him, don't you? He's Clint Eastwood and him, John Wells, the great actor Gianmaria Volonti. They were the men who excited you so in for a fistful of dollars. Here they are united once more, Clint Eastwood and Gianmaria Volonti under the inspired direction of Sergio Leone, better known as Bob Robertson. And for added good measure, Lee Van Cleef in a fast moving film crowded with action. For a few dollars more. It's the story of two bounty killers, men who inspired fear in the worst criminals. What made these men tick? Well, there's such a big reward being offered on all you gentlemen that I thought I might just tag along on your next robbery. Might just turn you into the law. Naturally. I'll be in the tavern. The air around here stinks anyway, just like the food. But the month will go fast. Yes, these men knew how to wait.

-WPxTWDEtAg,3727,Near Dark (1987)," Hi, I'm Karen Kusama and you're watching Trailers from Hell. I'm introducing Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark, her 1987 vampire western that probably more than any genre film I've seen has influenced me in terms of the kind of movies I want to make. What makes Near Dark so interesting and groundbreaking in my opinion is that it really is a true genre hybrid and we don't see many films like this because they're often difficult to release and they're difficult to market. And this was such a successful version in my opinion of managing to put its vampire story in a completely new landscape, the sort of western, southern landscape, and give it a very fresh feeling. It features an amazing cast, some of the James Cameron crew from Aliens, the great Lance Henryxson, Bill Paxton, Jeanette Goldstein, and then Jenny Wright and Adrian Pasdar who play the star-crossed lovers. Adrian Pasdar playing just a regular boy and Jenny Wright playing a sort of cowgirl vampire. The film is peppered with amazing set pieces, some of the most memorable in horror history in my opinion, starting with the first bite in which Jenny Wright's character first converts Adrian Pasdar's Caleb into a vampire and then the first feed in which she feeds him her own blood as a means to help him survive. It's incredibly unapologetically erotic. It's very unusual to see a film like this take that position. It's a very female position somehow. And I often found too that I was struck by the tour de force action sequences, namely the sequence in the hotel in which bullet holes create shafts of light that instantaneously burn the characters and create flames on their bodies. And then an amazing sequence in a bar in which there's a systematic slaughter of everyone in the bar and a feeding by all of those vampires. It's a really, really beautifully made film. It's beautifully shot. It's beautifully edited. And there's a freshness to it, a humor to it, and a real sense of inventiveness that I think gives it every reason to be rewatched now. It's a really, really good movie."

RsWPMM8iD2Y,3735,Serpico (1973)," Hello, my name is Adam Rifkin. Welcome back to Trailers from Hell. Today we're going to talk about a classic 70s movie. In the 1970s, Hollywood was undergoing a renaissance. The big Hollywood studios were broke, all their musicals were flopping, and a group of maverick filmmakers were given free reign to do movies that were more character-driven, political-minded, and challenged the status quo. One of the cornerstone movies of the whole generation under the influence genre is Serpico. Let's talk about it now. Frank Serpico. Serpico is a 1973 cop drama directed by the great Sidney Lumet. It's based on the true story of real New York City policeman, Frank Serpico, who went undercover to expose corruption in the New York City police department, and it stars Al Pacino as the undercover hippie cop who refused to be sucked into the world of corruption that infested the police force around him. The film is based on the book by Peter Maas, who prior to writing Frank Serpico's biography, also wrote the Velache papers. The screenplay was written by the fantastic Waldo Sals, who wrote many of my favorite movies of the era, including Midnight Cowboy and The Day of the Locust and Coming Home, and it was also written by Norman Wexler, who wrote Saturday Night Fever, which was obviously a huge hit, and Joe, which is another great socially relevant movie of the period about the dark side of Americana. The film was produced by Martin Bregman, who actually would go on to work with Al Pacino numerous times, producing Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, Sea of Love, and Carlito's Way, and the film was executive produced by the very prolific Dino De Laurentiis. Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino made a great team, and the themes in Serpico, Lumet explored again and again throughout his career, themes like the fragility of justice, police corruption, and characters with an urgent commitment to ethical responsibility. Frank Serpico is the quintessential Sidney Lumet hero, in that he defies peer pressure, and he's committed to his own code of moral values, and in Lumet's autobiography he actually describes Serpico as a portrait of a real rebel with a cause. Lumet started his career as an actor, so Lumet actually has become known as being a great actor's director. It's one of the things he's very famous for, and he's worked with the best of them over the years, and he often works with actors who are famous for having studied the method acting, and employing the method acting technique, which is a very intense immersion in the character, and one of the great famous method actors of all time is Al Pacino, who in his early career studied under method acting guru Lee Strasburg. Lumet obviously loves New York, and 1970s New York was a hotbed of social problems, moral ambiguity, and political corruption. Serpico is one of those great searing social issue movies that you could just never make today. The early 70s were the era of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate, and the country was pissed off that it was being lied to, and people actually cared in those days. There's a lot more apathy today. Society as a whole was questioning the status quo, and wasn't taking the established institutions of authority for granted anymore, and everybody was questioning everything, and people wanted the truth exposed about what was going on behind closed doors of power. Frank Serpico was actually the perfect hero for the time. He didn't just expose police corruption, but his whole long-haired, bearded, hippie cop look was the antithesis of everything associated with conformity, and that's one of the things that I loved about the movie. The performance was very authentic, and the real Frank Serpico loved the performance by Al Pacino. I guess who wouldn't? I mean, if Al Pacino played me, it wouldn't matter how much he was screaming, I'd have loved that performance too, obviously. Al Pacino had just come off The Godfather, which was a huge hit, and so suddenly he's this actor in serious demand. He was being offered everything, but he wanted to make sure that he did a role as his next role that was completely different than Michael Corleone. Serpico actually got him an Academy Award nomination, and Al Pacino was on an amazing run at this time. I mean, aside from Serpico, Al Pacino had Godfather 1, Godfather 2, Dog Day Afternoon, and Justice for All. I mean, actors just don't get those kind of opportunities anymore, and it's no surprise that he became such a big star. So the real life Serpico wanted to be on the set all the time because the movie was based on him. He wanted to make sure everything was authentic, but it was making Al Pacino feel self-conscious, so Sidney Lumet had to kick him off the set. Anyway, aside from the brilliant social impact the film had on the cinematic landscape, Serpico also holds the distinction of being the first time in a movie the line, Drop your cocks and grab your socks was ever uttered."

You'll be out of here by tomorrow morning. No, I won't. I'll never reach me by tomorrow morning. You'll be out of here in 12 hours. Hang on! Kirk Douglas has his greatest role as the reporter who would do anything for a story. Jan Sterling becomes a star of the first rank as the not-so-heartbroken wife of the man buried beneath the mountain. Maybe we'll have a couple of drinks. Maybe you'll even take me out for a big evening, huh? Why don't you wash that platinum out of your hair? Phony, below-the-belt journalism, that's what it is. Not below the belt, right in the gut, Mr. Booth. Human interest. Nothing you've ever seen before has the tremendous human interest of ace in the hole. For here is a startling story of human emotions and human desires, played against the most exciting fight to save a man's life ever depicted on the screen. Now, when Smollett comes, you can give him your orders. Tell him to go in through the cliff dwelling short up and get him out fast. Not through the cliff dwelling. You can't get him out that way anymore."

No hunting, no hiking, no admission, no trespassing. Private property, closed area. Start moving, get lost, drop dead, go away. Life can never cage a man like Jack Burns. It never has. For him, everything was a child. He was a child. He was a child. He was a child. It never has. For him, everything was a challenge. Fences were to be cut. Horses were to be tamed. A woman was to be loved. And life, life was to be lived fully in wild, lusty adventure. I only got one arm. You ain't afraid to fight a one-armed man, are you? Just stand where you are, boys. Follow on his action. I'm glad to comedy him. Do it with one arm behind my back. Host starring Gina Rollins. You broke out of jail, didn't you? Walter Mathau. Michael Caine. In the tense drama of one man's desperate defiance of a world he had never made. Actually photographed amid the perilous cliffs and escarpments of the 10,000 foot high Sandia Mountains of New Mexico. Will I ever see you again? Oh, sure you will. Oh, I always missed you, Jack. Always will. Plug in the speaker. We got him. He's right below us. I'll lower a rope letter. I'll climb down and get him."
qKykxE7CBbc,3741,Badlands (1973)," He was 25 years old. He combed his hair like James Dean. He was very fastidious. People who littered bothered him. She was 15.

In 1959, they murdered a lot of people. Of course I had to keep all this a secret from my dad. He would have had a fit since Kit was 10 years older than me and came from the wrong side of the track, so-called. I don't want you hanging around anymore. I don't want to see you again. Understand? Then, sure enough, Dad found out I'd been running around behind his back. He was madder than I'd ever seen him. He made me take extra music lessons every day after school and wait there until he came to pick me up. He said that if the piano didn't keep me off the streets, maybe the clarinet would. My girl Holly and I decided to kill ourselves the same way I did her dad. Nobody's coming out of this thing happy, especially not us. I can't deny we've had fun, though. We hid out in the wilderness, down by a river in a grove of cottonwoods. It'd be in the flood season we built our house in the trees. We planned a huge network of tunnels under the forest floor, and our first order of business every morning was to decide on a new password. He gave me lectures on how a gun works, how to take it apart and put it back together again, in case I had to carry on without him. He said that if the devil came at me, I could shoot him with a gun. Hey! Listen to your parents and teachers. They got a line on most things, so don't treat them like enemies. There's always an outside chance you can learn something. Try to keep an open mind. Try to understand the viewpoints of others. I think I got him. I don't know. Well, I'm not going down there and look. Consider the minority opinion, but try to get along with the majority of opinion, once it's accepted. Of course, Holly and I have had fun, even if it has been rushed. So far we're doing fine. I hadn't got caught. Excuse the grammar."

Inspiring a whirlicane of socials such as this press club luncheon where Ms. Remick hears Mr. Preminger thank the citizens of the state for their cooperation during the filming of the picture on locations in upper Michigan. Also, this Rotary Club luncheon honoring Mr. Welch, who before making his debut as the judge in Anatomy of a Murder, was a nationally famous Bay State lawyer. Then there was this Freedom Festival luncheon at which Michigan Supreme Court Justice John Volcker, the author of Anatomy of a Murder, Broadway actor George Scott, a local boy, and Lee Remick received keys to the city from Mrs. Louis Moranney. As Mr. Preminger again expresses his gratitude. Pacific Parade, too, marks the excitement and Governor G.

That you, Christopher Bedford, went out last night with a man you find attractive, and you didn't even try to get him into bed? That's what I mean. Why not? Because sex can ruin things sometimes. It's much more important to cultivate close personal friendships than anonymous group sex. It is? We've had six dates, and I'm telling you, I'm absolutely falling head over heels. Who would believe it? You better be careful. Or what? Or I might just fall in love with you. So I guess you're the one and only Christopher. Glad to meet you. My name's Kenny. Let's do his roommate.

When was the last time you saw Christopher acting like that about anybody? I can tell you one thing. I don't envy you. Me? What do you mean? Because if they break up, that Christopher Bedford's gonna be one mess of pieces to pick up. I don't think they're gonna break up. Hope you're right. I love you. Let's get some sleep, okay? Okay.

SWdPmapuOd4,3871,Shane (1953)," George Stevens, creator of such masterpieces as Giant and his Academy Award winning, enlarges the scope of the screen with a motion picture whose monumental background is matched by the stature of its moving human drama. Drama that began when a mysterious stranger rode in from out of nowhere to play a decisive role in the lives of these rugged pioneers. Call me Shane. Shane, who attracted the woman with his quiet strength, who fascinated the boy with the glint of his gun. We'd all be much better off if there wasn't a single gun left in this valley. A gun is as good or bad as a man using it. From the clash of elemental forces, George Stevens has created a motion picture unforgettable for its spectacle and scope, its great human story, its deadly conflict. I've heard about you.

K-BggWWn_bw,3911,Best in Show (2000)," Hi, I'm Alan Arkish and this is Trailers from Hell. When you make a movie that has unique style and point of view, it can puzzle the critics. Make a couple more movies in this unique style and the puzzling critics have to give it a name, a genre, like mockumentary. From Spinal Tap to the upcoming Mascot, Chris Guest has made movies with unique and distinct style. They are not mockumentaries because he doesn't mock anyone. Quite the contrary, his characters are created without judgment and with a genuine empathy. These fictitious people show great determination to succeed in life, yet they are blissfully unaware that they are doomed to failure, which is of course the thing that makes Chris Guest's body of work so damn funny. That and the tremendous improvisational chemistry of his stock company of actors. Our trailer from Hell is one of his best. In fact, it's best in show. Live from Philadelphia, it's the 125th annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. 3,000 dogs competing for best in show. To think that in some countries these dogs are eaten. Chris Guest got the idea for best in show by observing the eccentric behavior of dog owners and their pets at his local dog park. From there, he and Eugene Levy wrote a 16 page outline tracking the arc of each story. The actors create very detailed backstories and then their preparations begin. Like Parker Posey had adult braces installed and every cast member took an intensive week-long class and dog handling. When the shooting begins, the goal is to have complete spontaneity on the set. Each scene has an in and out point that contributes to the overall story. The first take is often the funniest and the most truthful. With that in mind, there is no rehearsal. The cameras roll and the actors improvise all the dialogue and behavior. Michael McKean says that it feels like you're working naked, but then again everyone else is naked too. They shot best in show in six weeks and the 60 hours of footage took eight months to cut down to a tight 89 minutes. A bloodhound not only has a great nose, but they can talk. What you doing, bloodhound doggy? What you doing? What you doing? And he's saying I'm ready. That's when you know he's ready for show. No real dog show would allow themselves to be filmed, so producer Karen Murphy put together her own. It took three months and involved over a hundred dogs, trainers and consultants. Fred Willard, who plays a Joe Garagiola-like chief announcer, was instructed to learn nothing about dogs or dog show. That's my favorite, the miniature schnauzer. You'd think they'd want to breed them bigger, wouldn't you, like grapefruits or watermelons. The result is unique, honest and spontaneous. He went after her like she's made out of ham."
